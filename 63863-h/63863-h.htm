<p>To send a book into the world without
a preface is like thrusting a bashful man
into a room full of company without introducing
him; and there could be only
one thing worse than that,&mdash;to a bashful
man,&mdash;and that would be to introduce
him.</p>

<p>In introducing my book to the reader
(how like a book-agent that sounds!) I
wish to say that the only bond of union
between the various sketches is that they
were all done by the same hand&mdash;or
hands, as they were written on a typewriter.</p>

<p>Whether it would have added to their
interest to have placed the same characters
in each sketch is not for me to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_x"></a>[x]</span>
say, but it would have been a great
bother to do it, and in getting up a book
the thing to avoid is bother. It hasn’t
bothered me to write it. I hope it won’t
bother you to read it, for I’d hate to have
you bothered on my account.</p>

THE FOUR-MASTED CAT-BOAT</h4>
</div>

<p class="pfs80">AN ETCHING OF THE SEA, BY A
LANDLUBBER</p>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_dct.jpg"  alt="T" /></div>

<p class="drop-cap">The sea lay low in the offing, and
as far as the eye could reach, immense
white-caps rode upon it as
quietly as pond-lilies on the bosom of a
lake.</p>

<p>Fleecy clouds dotted the sky, and far
off toward the horizon a full-rigged four-masted
cat-boat lugged and luffed in the
calm evening breezes. Her sails were
piped to larboard, starboard, and port;
and as she rolled steadily along in the
heavy wash and undertow, her companion-light,
already kindled, shed a delicate ray
across the bay to where the dull red disk
of the sun was dipping its colors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span></p>

<p>Her cordage lay astern, in the neat coils
that seamen know so well how to make.
The anchor had been weighed this half-hour,
and the figures put down in the log;
for Captain Bliffton was not a man to put
off doing anything that lay in the day’s
watch.</p>

<p>Away to eastward, two tiny black
clouds stole along as if they were diffident
strangers in the sky, and were anxious to
be gone. Now and again came the report
of some sunset gun from the forts that
lined the coast, and sea-robins flew with
harsh cries athwart the sloop of fishing-boats
that were beating to windward with
gaffed topsails.</p>

<p>“Davy Jones’ll have a busy day to-morrow,”
growled Tom Bowsline, the first
boatswain’s mate.</p>

<p>“Meaning them clouds is windy?” answered
the steward, with a glance to leeward.</p>

<p>“The same,” answered the other, shaking
out a reef, and preparing to batten
the tarpaulins. “What dinged fools
them fellers on the sloop of fishin’-ships<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
is! They’ve got their studdin’sails
gaffed and the mizzentops aft of the gangway;
an’ if I know a marlinspike from a
martingale, we’re goin’ to have as pretty
a blow as ever came out of the south.”</p>

<p>And, indeed, it did look to be flying in
the face of Providence, for the mackerel-ships,
to the last one, were tugging and
straining to catch the slightest zephyr,
with their yard-arms close-hauled and
their poop-decks flush with the fo’c’sle.</p>

<p>The form of the captain of the cat-boat
was now visible on the stairs leading to
the upper deck. It needed but one keen
glance in the direction of the black clouds&mdash;no
longer strangers, but now perfectly
at home and getting ugly&mdash;to determine
his course. “Unship the spinnaker-boom,
you dogs, and be quick about it! Luff,
you idiot, luff!” The boatswain’s first
mate loved nothing better than to luff, and
he luffed; and the good ship, true to her
keel, bore away to northward, her back
scuppers oozing at every joint.</p>

<p>“That was ez neat a bit of seamanship
ez I ever see,” said Tom Bowsline, taking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
a huge bite of oakum. “Shiver my timbers!
if my rivets don’t tremble with joy
when I see good work.”</p>

<p>“Douse your gab, and man the taff-rail!”
yelled the captain; and Tom flew
to obey him. “Light the top-lights!”</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp99" id="i004" style="max-width: 37.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_004.jpg"  alt="" />
</div>

<p>A couple of sailors to whom the trick is
a mere bagatelle run nimbly out on the
stern-sprit and execute his order; and
none too soon, for darkness is closing in
over the face of the waters, and the clouds
come on apace.</p>

<p>A rumble of thunder, followed by a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
blinding flash, betokens that the squall is
at hand. The captain springs adown the
poop, and in a hoarse voice yells out:
“Lower the maintop; loosen the shrouds;
luff a little&mdash;steady! Cut the main-brace,
and clear away the halyards. If we don’t
look alive, we’ll look pretty durn dead
in two shakes of a capstan-bar. All hands
abaft for a glass of grog.”</p>

<p>The wild rush of sailors’ feet, the creaking
of ropes, the curses of those in the
rear, together with the hoarse cries of the
gulls and the booming of the thunder,
made up a scene that beggars description.
Every trough of the sea was followed by
a crest as formidable, and the salt spray
had an indescribable brackish taste like
bilge-water and ginger-ale.</p>

<p>After the crew had finished their grog
they had time to look to starboard of the
port watch, and there they beheld what
filled them with pity. The entire sloop
of mackerel-ships lay with their keels up.</p>

<p>“I knowed they’d catch it if they
gaffed their studdin’sails,” said Tom, as
he shifted the quid of oakum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span></p>

<p>The full moon rose suddenly at the exact
spot where the sun had set. The
thunder made off, muttering. The cat-boat,
close-rigged from hand-rail to taff-rail,
scudded under bare poles, with the
churning motion peculiar to pinnaces, and
the crew involuntarily broke into the
chorus of that good old sea-song:</p>

A PECULIAR INDUSTRY</h4>
</div>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_dct.jpg"  alt="T" /></div>

<p class="drop-cap">The sign in front of the dingy little
office on a side-street, through
which I was walking, read:</p>

<p class="pfs90 wsp">
JO COSE AND JOCK EWLAH<br />
FUNSMITHS</p>

<p>Being of an inquisitive turn of mind, I
went in. A little dried-up man, who introduced
himself as Mr. Cose, greeted me
cheerily. He said that Mr. Ewlah was
out at lunch, but he’d be pleased to do
what he could for me.</p>

<p>“What is the nature of your calling?”
asked I.</p>

<p>“It is you who are calling,” said he,
averting his eyes. Then he assumed the
voice and manner of a “lecturer” in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
dime museum, and rattled along as
follows:</p>

<p>“We are in the joke business. Original
and second-hand jokes bought and sold.
Old jokes made over as good as new.
Good old stand-bys altered to suit the
times. Jokes cleaned and made ready for
the press. We do not press them ourselves.
Joke expanders for sale cheap.
Also patent padders for stories&mdash;”</p>

<p>I interrupted the flow of his talk to ask
him if there was much demand for the
padders.</p>

<p>“Young man,” said he, “do you keep
up with current literature?”</p>

<p>Then he went over to a shelf on which
stood a long line of bottles of the size of
cod-liver-oil bottles, and taking one down,
he said: “Now, here is Jokoleine, of which
we are the sole agents. This will make a
poor joke salable, and is in pretty general
use in the city, although some editors will
not buy a joke that smells of it.”</p>

<p>I noticed a tall, black-haired, Svengalic-looking
person in an inner room, and I
asked Mr. Cose who he was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<p>“That is our hypnotizer. The most
callous editors succumb to his gaze. Take
him with you when you have anything to
sell. We rent him at a low figure, considering
how useful he is. He
has had a busy season, and
is tired out, but that is what
we pay him for. If he were
to die you’d notice a difference
in many of the periodicals.
The poorer the
material, the better pleased
he is to place it. It flatters
his vanity.”</p>

<div class="figleft illowe8_125" id="i012">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_012.jpg"  alt="" />
</div>

<p>I assured him that I was
something of a hypnotist myself, and,
thanking him for his courtesy, was about
to come away, when he picked up what
looked like a box of tacks and said:</p>

<p>“Here are points for pointless jokes.
We don’t have much sale for them. Most
persons prefer an application of Jokoleine.
A recent issue of a comic weekly had sixty
jokes and but one point, showing conclusively
that points are out of fashion in
some editorial rooms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span></p>

<p>“A man came in yesterday,” rattled on
the senior member, “and asked if we
bought hand-made jokes, and before we
could stop him he said that by hand-made
jokes he meant jokes about servant-girls.
We gave him the address of ‘Punch.’”</p>

<p>At this point I shook hands with Mr.
Cose, and as I left he was saying: “For
a suitable consideration we will guarantee
to call anything a joke that you may bring
in, and we will place it without hypnotic
aid or the use of Jokoleine. It has been
done before.”</p>

<p>And as I came away from the sound of
his voice, I reflected that it had.</p>

GRIGGS’S MIND</h4>
</div>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_dct.jpg"  alt="T" /></div>

<p class="drop-cap">The other day I met Griggs on the
cars. Griggs is the man with
the mind. Other people have
minds, but they’re not like Griggs’s. He
lives in Rutherford, New Jersey, and is,
like me, a commuter, and as neither of
us plays cards nor is interested in politics,
and as we have tabooed the weather as a
topic, it almost always happens that when
we meet, we, or rather he, falls back on
his mind as subject for conversation. For
my part, my daily newspaper would be
all-sufficient for my needs on the way to
town; but it pleases Griggs to talk, and
it’s bad for my eyes to read on the cars,
so I shut them up and cultivate the air of
listening, the while Griggs discourses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span></p>

<p>I had recently read in the Contributors’
Club of the “Atlantic,” an article by a
woman, who said that the letters of the
alphabet seemed to be variously colored
in her mind; that is, her mental picture
gave to one letter a green hue, to another
red, and so on. I spoke of this to Griggs,
and he was much interested. He said
that the sound of a cornet was always red
to him. I asked him whether it made any
difference who blew it, but Griggs scorns
to notice puns, and he answered: “Not a
particle. I don’t pretend to explain it,
but it is so. Likewise, to me the color
of scarlet tastes salt, while crimson is
sweet.”</p>

<p>I opened my eyes and looked at him in
amazement. It sounded like a bit out of
“Alice in Wonderland.” Then I remembered
that it was Griggs who was talking,
and that he has a mind. When I don’t understand
something about Griggs, I lay it to
his mind and think no more about it. So
I shut my eyes again and listened.</p>

<p>“By the way,” said he, “how does
time run in your mind?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span></p>

<p>“Why, I never thought of its running
at all, although it passes quickly enough,
for the most part!”</p>

<p>“But hasn’t it some general direction?
Up or down, north or south, east or
west?”</p>

<p>“Griggs,” said I, “is this your mind?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said he.</p>

<p>“Well, go ahead; fire it off; unfold
your kinks!” said I, leaning back in my
seat; “but kindly remember that I have
no mind, and if you can’t put it in words
of one syllable, talk slowly so that I can
follow you.”</p>

<p>He promised to put it as plainly as
though he were talking to his youngest,
aged three; and, with this assurance, my
cerebrum braced itself, so to speak, and
awaited the onslaught.</p>

<p>“My idea of the direction of time in all
its divisions and subdivisions is as follows&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Say, Griggs,” said I, “let’s go into
the smoker. A little oil of nicotine always
makes my brain work easier.”</p>

<p>When we were seated in the smoker,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
and had each lighted a cigar, he went
on:</p>

<p>“Assuming that I am facing the north,
far in the southwest is the Garden of Eden
and the early years of recorded time.
Moving eastward run the centuries, and
the years to come and the end of the
world are in the far east.”</p>

<p>I felt slightly bewizzled, but I gripped
the seat in front of me and said nothing.</p>

<p>“My mental picture of the months of
the year is that January is far to the north.
The months follow in a more or less
zigzag, easterly movement, until we find
that July and August have strayed far
south. But the autumn months zigzag
back, so that by the time December
sweeps coldly by she is twelve months
east of January, and then the new January
starts on a road of similar direction.
You still observe that the current of time
sets toward me instead of away from
me.”</p>

<p>What could I do but observe that it did?
I had the inside seat, and Griggs has an
insistent way about him, so I generally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
observe just when he asks me to, and thus
avoid friction. Then, too, I always feel
flattered when Griggs condescends to talk
at me and reveal the wonders of his mind.
So I observed heartily, and puffed away
at my cigar, while he continued:</p>

<p>“The direction of the week-days is
rather hazy in my mind&mdash;”</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp70" id="i018" style="max-width: 16.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_018.jpg"  alt="" />
</div>

<p>I begged him not to feel low-spirited
about it&mdash;that it would probably seem
clear to him before long; but I don’t think
he heard me, for he went right on: “But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
it is a somewhat undulatory movement
from west to east, Sundays being on the
crest of each wave. Coming to the hours,
I picture them as running, like the famous
mouse, ‘down the clock,’ the early day-light
being highest. The minutes and
seconds refuse to be marshaled into line,
but go ticking on to eternity helter-skelter,
yet none the less inevitably.”</p>

<p>I rather admired the independence of
the minutes and seconds in refusing to be
ordered about even by his mind; but, of
course, I didn’t tell him so. On the contrary,
I congratulated him on the highly
poetic way in which he was voicing his
sentiments.</p>

<p>Just then we came into the station, and
an acquaintance of his buttonholed him
and lugged him off, for Griggs is quite a
favorite, in spite of his mind. I was sorry,
for I had wanted to ask him where the moments
and instants seem bound for in his
brain. I did manage, just as we were
leaving the boat at Chambers Street, to
tell him that I was going to be in the
Augustan part of the city at noon, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
would be pleased to take him out to lunch,
if he ran across me; but he must have
mistaken the month, as I ate my luncheon
alone. I dare say he understood me to
say January, and wandered all over Harlem
looking for me. How unpleasant it
must be to have a mind!</p>

THE SIGNALS OF GRIGGS</h4>
</div>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_dcy.jpg"  alt="Y" /></div>

<p class="drop-cap">You may remember Griggs as the
man who had a mind. At the
time that I wrote about that useful
member of his make-up he was living
out in New Jersey; but he was finally
brought to see the error of his ways, and
took the top flat in a nine-story house
without an elevator, ’way up-town.</p>

<p>The other evening I went to call on
the Griggses. He had not yet come home,
but his wife let me in and helped me to
a sofa to recover from the effects of my
climb. I have been up the Matterhorn,
Mont Blanc, and Popocatepetl, but I never
felt so exhausted as I did after walking up
those nine frightful flights. And Mrs.
Griggs told me that she thought nothing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
of running up- and down-stairs a dozen
times a day, which was a sad commentary
on her truthfulness.</p>

<p>After I was there a few minutes, trying
to get used to the notes of two lusty and
country-bred children (offspring of Mr.
and Mrs. Griggs), there came a feeble and
dejected ring at the front-door bell. Mrs.
Griggs hastened to the kitchen,&mdash;they do
not keep a servant (that was their trouble
in New Jersey, but now they don’t want
to),&mdash;and after pressing the electric button
that opened the front door, she said:
“That’s poor Mr. Griggs. He must be
feeling bad to-night, and I must put the
children to bed before he gets up, as he is
too nervous to stand their noise.”</p>

<p>I was somewhat astonished, but she
ripped the clothes off of her buds of
promise and popped them into bed with
a skill and rapidity that would have secured
her a position on the vaudeville
stage. After they were covered up she
returned to me. Of course Mr. Griggs
had not yet arrived, and I asked her how
she knew he was tired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter illowp46" id="i023" style="max-width: 16.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_023.jpg"  alt="" />
</div>

<p>“Why, we have a code of signals. Mr.
Griggs invented them. When he has
done well down-town, he taps out a merry
peal on the bell, and then I tell the children
to greet him at the hall door and
prepare for a romp. When the bell rings
sharply I know that he is in no humor for
fun, but will tolerate the children if they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
are quiet. But when he rings slowly and
faintly, as he did to-night, I always put
the dears to bed, as I know he has had
bad luck and is worn out.”</p>

<p>As she spoke, Griggs opened the hall
door and staggered in, weak from his
superhuman climb and worn out from his
day’s work. I said: “Good-by, old man;
I’ll call some day when you’re going to
give the bell the glad hand. You seem
cozily situated.” And then I came down
in the dumb-waiter, although I suppose it
was risky.</p>

<p>What a great thing is an electric bell!
But how much greater is an inventive
mind like that of Griggs.</p>

À LA SHERLOCK HOLMES</h4>
</div>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_dcj.jpg"  alt="J" /></div>

<p class="drop-cap">Jones and I recently had occasion
to take a drive of four or five
miles in upper Connecticut. We
were met at the station by Farmer Phelps,
who soon had us snugly wrapped in robes
and speeding over the frozen highway in
a sleigh. It was bitter cold weather&mdash;the
thermometer reading 3° above zero. We
had come up from Philadelphia, and to us
such extreme cold was a novelty, which
is all we could say for it.</p>

<p>As we rode along, Jones fell to talking
about Conan Doyle’s detective stories, of
which we were both great admirers&mdash;the
more so as Doyle has declared Philadelphia
to be the greatest American city. It
turned out that Mr. Phelps was familiar with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
the “‘Meemoirs’ of Sherlock Holmes,”
and he thought there was some “pretty
slick reasonin’” in it. “My girl,” said
he, “got the book out er the library an’
read it aout laoud to my woman an’ me.
But of course this Doyle had it all cut an’
dried afore he writ it. He worked backwards
an’ kivered up his tracks, an’ then
started afresh, an’ it seems more wonderful
to the reader than it reely is.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Jones; “I’ve
done a little in the observation line since I
began to read him, and it’s astonishing
how much a man can learn from inanimate
objects, if he uses his eyes and his brain
to good purpose. I rarely make a mistake.”</p>

<p>Just then we drove past an outbuilding.
The door of it was shut. In front of it,
in a straight row and equidistant from
each other, lay seven cakes of ice, thawed
out of a water-pan.</p>

<p>“There,” said Jones; “what do we gather
from those seven cakes of ice and that
closed door?”</p>

<p>I gave it up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Phelps said nothing.</p>

<p>Jones waited impressively a moment,
and then said quite glibly: “The man
who lives there keeps a flock of twelve
hens&mdash;not Leghorns, but probably Plymouth
Rocks or some Asiatic variety. He
attends to them himself, and has good success
with them, although this is the seventh
day of extremely cold weather.”</p>

<p>I gazed at him in admiration.</p>

<p>Mr. Phelps said nothing.</p>

<p>“How do you make it all out, Jones?”
said I.</p>

<p>“Well, those cakes of ice were evidently
formed in a hens’ drinking-pan. They
are solid. The water froze a little all day
long, and froze solid in the night. It was
thawed out in the morning and left lying
there, and the pan was refilled. There
are seven cakes of ice; therefore there has
been a week of very cold weather. They
are side by side: from this we gather
that it was a methodical man who attended
to them; evidently no hireling, but
the goodman himself. Methodical in little
things, methodical in greater ones; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
method spells success with hens. The thickness
of the ice also proves that comparatively
little water was drunk; consequently
he keeps a small flock. Twelve is the model
number among advanced poultrymen, and
he is evidently one.
Then, the clearness
of the ice shows
that the hens are
not excitable Leghorns,
but fowl of a
more sluggish kind,
although whether
Plymouth Rocks or
Brahmas or Langshans, I can’t say. Leghorns
are so wild that they are apt to stampede
through the water and roil it. The
closed door shows he has the good sense
to keep them shut up in cold weather.</p>

<div class="figleft illowe15_625" id="i028">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_028.jpg"  alt="" />
</div>

<p>“To sum up, then, this wide-awake poultryman
has had wonderful success, in spite
of a week of exceptionally cold weather,
from his flock of a dozen hens of some
large breed. How’s that, Mr. Phelps?
Isn’t it almost equal to Doyle?”</p>

<p>“Yes; but not accordin’ to Hoyle, ez<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
ye might say,” said he. “Your reasonin’
is good, but it ain’t quite borne aout by
the fac’s. In the fust place, this is the fust
reel cold day we’ve hed this winter.
Secon’ly, they ain’t no boss to the place,
fer she’s a woman. Thirdly, my haouse
is the nex’ one to this, an’ my boy an’
hers hez be’n makin’ those ice-cakes fer
fun in some old cream-pans. Don’t take
long to freeze solid in this weather. An’,
las’ly, it ain’t a hen-haouse, but an ice-haouse.”</p>

<p>The sun rode with unusual quietness
through the heavens. We heard no song
of bird. The winds were whist. All nature
was silent.</p>

<p>So was Jones.</p>

MY SPANISH PARROT</h4>
</div>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_dci.jpg"  alt="I" /></div>

<p class="drop-cap">I have two maiden aunts living
down in Maine, on the edge of the
woods. Their father was a deaf-and-dumb
woodsman, and their mother
died when they were small, and they hardly
see a soul from one year’s end to the other.
The consequence is, they’re the simplest,
dearest old creatures one ever saw. They
don’t know what evil means. They pass
their days knitting and working in their
garden. The quarterly visits of the itinerant
preacher who deals out the gospel in
that region, and my occasional trips up
there, constitute the only chances they
have of mingling with the outside world,
and they’re as happy and unsophisticated
as birds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span></p>

<p>A year ago I took up a parrot that I’d
bought of a sailor. The bird had a cold
when I got it, and wasn’t saying a word;
but the sailor vouched for its character,
and I thought it would be a novelty and
company for the old ladies, so I took it
along. They’d never seen a parrot before,
and they couldn’t thank me enough.
I told them that when it got over its cold
it would talk; and then it occurred to me
that as the sailor of which I bought it was
a Spaniard, the bird would be likely to
speak that tongue. “So you’ll be able
to learn Spanish,” said I; and they were
mightily pleased at the notion.</p>

<p>In about two months I received a letter
from Aunt Linda, saying that the bird
was the greatest company in the world,
and they didn’t know what they’d do
without him. “And,” wrote my aunt,
“the bird is a great talker of Spanish, and
we have learned much of that strange
tongue.”</p>

<p>I was amused at the idea of those
maiden aunts of mine talking Spanish, and
the next week, being in the vicinity, I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
took the stage over to where they live,
about fifteen miles from any railroad.</p>

<p>They saw me alight, and came out to
meet me&mdash;two pretty, sweet, prim-looking
old ladies. I kissed them both heartily, and
then Aunt Linda said, in her gentle voice:
“I’m so glad you’ve come, you dear old
blankety-blank blank blank boy. That’s
Spanish.”</p>

<p>I nearly fell off my perch, but I managed
to keep a straight face, and then
dear Aunt Jane said softly and proudly:
“Why the blankety-blank blank don’t you
come to see us oftener, you blankety-blank
blank boy?”</p>

<p>It made my blood run cold to hear the
oaths those innocent creatures poured out
on me all day. The parrot followed me
around, and perked his head on one side,
as much as to say, “Aren’t they apt
pupils?” but he never opened his mouth
to talk&mdash;and there really wasn’t any need.
They kept me supplied with conversation
on their quiet doings, all interlarded with
their new-found “Spanish,” until it was
time to go to bed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span></p>

<p>I hadn’t the heart to tell them that the
tongue in which they were so fluent was
not Spanish; and as their hearts were as
pure as a baby’s, and they saw no one, I
said nothing; but when I left, early next
morning, I was careful to bid them good-by
out of ear-shot of the stage-coach, and
it’s lucky I did, for the torrent of billingsgate
that they poured fondly over me
would have caused the occupants of the
coach to think entirely unwarranted things
of the old ladies.</p>

<p>As I climbed up to the seat by the driver,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
a man got out of the stage and walked
up to the house.</p>

<p>“Good heavens! who’s that?” I asked
of the driver.</p>

<p>“Thet,” said he, “is the Methody
preacher makin’ his quarterly visit to th’
old ladies.”</p>

“TO MEET MR. CAVENDISH”</h4>
</div>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_dct.jpg"  alt="T" /></div>

<p class="drop-cap">The card read, “To meet Mr.
Cavendish.” I had not been in
Boston long, and I must confess
to a poor head for names, so I had no idea
who Mr. Cavendish was or what he had
done, but as he was to be at Mrs. Emerson’s,
I knew he had done something.</p>

<p>There were only five guests there, besides
Mr. Cavendish, when I arrived, and
after we were introduced it so happened
that Cavendish and I found ourselves talking
together.</p>

<p>He looked tired, so I said as a starter:
“Don’t you find your work exhausting?”
I thought I’d play “twenty questions”
with him, and determine what he had
done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span></p>

<p>“Sometimes it is, very. The expenditure
of force fairly makes my throat
ache.”</p>

<p>It was easy. He was probably a Wagnerian
singer.</p>

<p>“I suppose you have to be very careful
about your throat.”</p>

<p>“Why, no,” he said; “I never think
about my throat.”</p>

<p>He wasn’t a singer.</p>

<p>“Well, you’re in love with your art.”</p>

<p>He smiled. “Yes, I’m in love with it.”</p>

<p>I was in despair. What was he?</p>

<p>But now I would nail him. “What are
your methods of work, Mr. Cavendish?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t spend much time in over-elaboration.
My brush-strokes are very
broad.”</p>

<p>Ah, a painter! “Exactly,” I said.
“You like a free hand.”</p>

<p>He said: “After all, the words are everything.”</p>

<p>Ah, a writer! “Yes,” said I; “your
words are everything to the public.”</p>

<p>“I hope so. I try to make them so,”
he said modestly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span></p>

<p>Now I felt easier, and proceeded to
praise him specifically.</p>

<p>“Which do you like best&mdash;to make
your public laugh or cry? or do you aim
to instruct it?”</p>

<p>“It is easy to make persons laugh, so I
suppose I like rather to bring them to
tears. As for instruction, there are those
who say it is not our province to instruct.”</p>

<p>“But you do all three, Mr. Cavendish.”</p>

<p>He bowed as if he thought I had hit
it.</p>

<p>I said: “To those who are familiar with
your work there is something that makes
you just the man to pick up for a quarter
of an hour.”</p>

<p>His blank expression showed that I had
made some mistake. He is a tall, portly
man, and he seemed alarmed at the prospect
of being picked up. A fall would be
serious.</p>

<p>“I don’t quite get your meaning, but I
suppose you refer to the men about town
who stray in for a few minutes.”</p>

<p>It seemed a queer way to express it,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
but I replied: “Oh, yes; just to browse.
You repay browsing, Mr. Cavendish.”</p>

<p>He smiled reminiscently. “Speaking
of browsing, when I was told to go ahead
on Richelieu, I browsed a long time in the
British Museum getting up data.”</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp51" id="i038" style="max-width: 25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_038.jpg"  alt="" />
</div>

<p>What, a painter, after all? I forgot all
else he had said, and told him I thought
he was as happy as Sargent or Whistler.</p>

<p>“Yes; I don’t let little things worry me<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
much. Sometimes the paint gives out at
a critical time in a small town.”</p>

<p>Good heaven! Why should the paint
give out in a small town at a critical time?
<em>Was</em> he a painter, after all? Could he be
a traveling sign-painter?</p>

<p>“Does it bother you to work up in the
air?”</p>

<p>“That’s an original way of putting it,”
said he, with a genial laugh. “To play to
the grand stand, as it were. Oh, no; a
man must do more or less of that to succeed.”</p>

<p>I was shocked. “You surely don’t
believe in desecrating nature! Sermons
in stones, if you will, but not sermons <em>on</em>
stones. You wouldn’t letter the Palisades
if you had a chance, would you?”</p>

<p>He edged away from me, and said:</p>

<p>“Oh, no, I wouldn’t letter the Palisades,
although I dare say my man of affairs
would be glad to.”</p>

<p>Then I gave up. His man of affairs!
He must be a gentleman of leisure to
have a man of affairs.</p>

<p>And then up came Ticknor Fields, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
dramatic critic, and said: “How do you
do, Mr. Cavendish? Let me congratulate
you upon your success as Richelieu. At
last a successor to Booth has been found.”</p>

<p>I went and drank a glass of iced water.
My throat was dry.</p>

INSTINCT SUPPLIED TO HENS</h4>
</div>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_dca.jpg"  alt="A" /></div>

<p class="drop-cap">A company has just been formed
in New Jersey for the purpose of
supplying instinct to hens. Such
well-known farmers as Frank R. Stockton,
Russell Sage, and Bishop Potter are stockholders
in it, and if filling a long-felt want
is all that is needed, the success of the
company is already assured.</p>

<p>No one who has ever dabbled in hens
needs to be told that the gallinaceous
birds have no instinct whatever. Some
have blind luck, but a hen with instincts
in good working order would be an
anomaly.</p>

<p>I visited Mr. Stockton at his extensive
farm in New Jersey in order to find out what
I could about the project. I found him in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
a frock-coat and overalls, training a squash-vine
up a maple-tree. He greeted me
cordially, and asked me to come and see
his tomato-trenches. He also showed me
quite an extensive area covered with birch
poles for his radishes to climb on. He
was very urbane, and willingly told me all
about the company.</p>

<p>“No man,” said he, sitting down on one
of his largest cucumbers and motioning
me to a seat on another, “who has ever
kept hens but has wondered why they
were not provided with a good commonsense
brand of instinct. No animal needs
instinct more than a hen. It was to supply
this need that our company was
formed. You know that if you put a hen
on cobblestones, she will brood over them
with all the devotion possible, and if at
the end of three weeks you put a baby
chicken under her, her&mdash;what you might
term false instinct&mdash;will cause her to cluck
and call to the cobble to come forth and
follow her.”</p>

<p>I admitted the force of his remark, because
when a boy I had once set a hen on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
some green apples, and she had covered
them without a murmur for a week, when
I took pity on her and replaced them with
real eggs. The following day, not liking
the feeling of the eggs, she left them, and
gathering together the apples that I had
left scattered upon the barn floor, she sat
on them again.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i043" style="max-width: 25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_043.jpg"  alt="" />
</div>

<p>I told this experience to Mr. Stockton,
and he said: “If she’d had a few of our
instinct-powders before sitting she would
have repudiated the fraud at once. Is it
instinct, or the lack of it,” he continued,
“that makes a heavy Light Brahma plant
a ponderous and feathered foot upon her
offspring and listen calmly to their expiring
peeps? It’s lack of it; she needs one
of our powders.”</p>

<p>I made a mental calculation of the
number of chickens that I had seen sacri<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>ficed
in that way by motherly and good-natured
hens who would have felt hurt if
you had told them that they did not know
how to bring up their young.</p>

<p>We had risen, and were now walking as
we talked, and we soon came to Mr. Stockton’s
corn-trellises. He is a great believer
in climbing, and it was a pretty sight to
see his corn waving in the breeze that blew
through the trellis netting.</p>

<p>“Poultry-raising would be an unmixed
joy,” said he, as he picked a turnip and
offered it to me, “if a fellow wasn’t constantly
running up against this lack of instinct
on the part of the fowls. If a hen
had instinct she’d know enough to keep
her mouth shut when she laid an egg; but
as it is, she cackles away like a woman
with a secret, and before she knows it her
egg is on the way to the table. But the
aim of our company will be to furnish each
hen with a sufficient amount of instinct
to render her profitable to her master.
When she has that instinct she will not sit
on her nest long after her eggs have been
removed; she will not walk off through the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
long grass, calling to her brood to follow
her, when the chicks have all been swallowed
by the treacherous domestic cat;
and she will not do the thousand and
one things that any hen, no matter what
her breed or breeding, will do, as it is.”</p>

<p>I told Mr. Stockton, as I shook hands
with him in parting, that there was not a
farmer, either amateur or professional, in
the whole Union, who would not be glad
to purchase a package of his instinct-powders;
and as I left the genial granger,
he was putting cushions under his watermelons
so that they would not get bruised
by contact with the earth.</p>

A SPRING IDYL</h4>
</div>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_dci.jpg"  alt="I" /></div>

<p class="drop-cap">It was a bright morning in early
spring&mdash;one of the delightful,
languorous days that take the sap
out of one and make the life of the tramp
seem blissful. The maples were just putting
forth their delicate crimson leaves,
and a warm south wind bore into the city
the smell of fresh earth. Ah, what longings
were stirred up in the breast of Key,
Pattit &amp; Company’s office-boy, country-bred,
but pent up in the city for a twelvemonth
past! Oh, for one day in the
country! He would follow the winding
trout-stream from its source in Perkins’s
meadow until it emptied into the Naugatuck,
and with angleworms dug from the
famous spot north of the barn he would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
lure the coy trout from their shaded lurking-places.</p>

<div class="figright illowe12_5" id="i047">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_047.jpg"  alt="" />
</div>

<p>Hark! what was that? The “drowsy
tinkling” of a cow-bell&mdash;of cow-bells.
What sweet music!
It drove him wild
with longing, as
louder and ever
louder, and nearer
and yet nearer,
came the sound of
bells. Ah, he could
see Jerry, the hired
man, driving the
cows up the grassy
lane. As usual, Betty,
the Jersey, was
in the lead. And
there was greedy
Daisy, lingering to crop the rich grass that
grew along the lane until Jerry’s “Whe-e-y,
whe-e-y!” should bid her hurry on. And
there were the twin heifers, Nanny and
Fanny, perfectly matched Holsteins. And
in the rear, plodding on with dignity and
fatness, was Diana, the great Devon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span></p>

<p>How the bells jangled! Surely it was
not seeming, but actuality. They were
right outside on the street.</p>

<p>Impulsively he ran to the office window
and looked down with boyish anticipation.</p>

<p>“Jingle-jangle!” went the bells.
“Rha-ags, rha-ags, any ol’ rha-ags!”
shouted the ragman.</p>

AN INVERTED SPRING IDYL</h4>
</div>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_dci.jpg"  alt="I" /></div>

<p class="drop-cap">It was a bright morning in the early
spring, a time to call forth poetic
fancies in the mind of the most
prosaic; and Jack was more imaginative
than many boys. He had been spending
the winter at his uncle’s in the country,
and these warm, languorous days had
made him long for New York once more.
He sat astride of a maple-branch, on which
the crimson leaves were just peeping out.
Ah me, what would he not give to be
back in the city! He leaned back against
the tree-trunk and gave himself over to
day-dreams.</p>

<p>The boys on his block were spinning
tops. Oh, for a good hard city pavement
for just five minutes, that he might do the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
same. Through the hazy air came the
anything but drowsy tinklings of the grip-men’s
gongs; a scissors-grinder blew his
horn; and the exciting clang of an ambulance-gong
split the air as the ambulance
rattled over the Belgian blocks. Oh,
for an hour of the dear city in the happy
springtime! To hear once more the piano-organ
and the harp, and the thousand delightful
sounds that were so lamentably
absent from the country!</p>

<div class="figleft illowe12_5" id="i050">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_050.jpg"  alt="" />
</div>

<p>What was that? Did he hear bells?
Yes, surely it was the ragman. He had
never realized how
he loved him. He
could see the fellow,
lean and ragged and
bent, pushing his
cart, while from his
lips came the cry
of “Rha-ags! rha-ags!”
and from
the sagging cord
the sweet bells
jingled. Yes, surely
it was the bells.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
All thought of the lonely country faded
away, and he was once more home; the
boys were just around the corner, and the
bells were coming nearer.</p>

<p>Their tintinnabulations grew so loud
that he waked from his day-dream and
saw&mdash;not a familiar and beloved city
sight, but a tiresome herd of cows coming
home to be milked, their harsh bells jangling
out of tune.</p>

AT THE CHESTNUTS’ DINNER</h4>
</div>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_dct.jpg"  alt="T" /></div>

<p class="drop-cap">The Hoary Chestnuts were assembling
for their annual Christmas
dinner. Sweet music was discoursed
by the chestnut bell, and, despite
their age and many infirmities, the members
wore a look of gaiety suitable to so
festive an occasion. There was not a
young joke among them, excepting a very
few special jokes like the Trolley variety
and the Cuban War joke, and these, from
overwork, were as superannuated-looking
as the oldest there. Not a well-known
joke but would come. Of course they
would all live until the next dinner, for an
old joke is immortal; but this yearly gathering
was their only chance to meet and
shake hands generally, as during the rest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
of the year they would be scattered
through the columns of the dailies and the
comic weeklies, and their meetings would
be chance ones.</p>

<p>The hearty old Mother-in-law joke
chatted gaily with that venerable old lady,
I-will-be-a-sister-to-you. The adorable
twins, Ballet-girl’s-age and Ballet-girl’s-scant-raiment,
were the center of a group
made up of the haughty Rich-plumber, the
Rejected-manuscript, the Slow-messenger-boy,
the Sleeping-watchman, and a good
score of Boarding-house jokes. The one
called Boarding-house-coffee felt a little
stirred up at the false report that he was
losing ground, and he had an unsettled
look upon his swarthy and senile features.
The idea was absurd on the face of it, for
undoubtedly he would be printed in every
section of the country before the month
was out, as he had been any month for
decades past. The Summer jokes, including,
of course, the star jest, the Summer-girl,
looked comparatively fresh, as they
were not in use the year round, like Her-father’s-foot,
for instance, or that other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
member of the same family, the Chicago-girl’s-foot,
that year in and year out is
used as a laugh-producer.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp79" id="i054" style="max-width: 21.875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_054.jpg"  alt="" />
</div>

<p>The Boston jokes, icy and reserved, sat
apart from the rest, and glared at each
other in a near-sighted way. The Freak
jokes, on the contrary, were hail-fellow-well-met
with every one, and their vulgar
laughter could be heard everywhere.</p>

<p>A good deal of sympathy was expressed
for Actor-walking-home, for he was so
feeble that he had to be helped across the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
room by Weary Wraggles. The Tramps
were out in force. Tickets to the dinner
were five dollars, and it was rumored that
Dusty Rhodes had worked his way in, but
upon reflection the idea will be seen to be
preposterous.</p>

<p>There was a strong smell of cloves in
the air when the door opened for the
entrance of old Between-the-acts. He
came arm in arm with that other favorite,
Detained-at-the-lodge.</p>

<p>The Farmer jokes came in a little late.
Their chores had detained them. But their
entrance was hailed with delight by a body
of paragraphers who sat in the gallery as
representatives of the press, and who had
paid many a bill, thanks to the Farmers.</p>

<p>A joke, rather square-cut and with
wheels in his head, came in with a “Where
is she?” look on his dial, and as soon as
he said, “I expected to meter here,” he
was recognized as Big-gas-bill. The
Wheel jokes were conspicuous by their
absence. This was explained on the
ground that they were not yet old enough
to become Hoary Chestnuts, and, as a re<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>lentless
paragrapher remarked, “They
were tired, anyhow.”</p>

<p>The last ones to arrive were the Cannibal
and Tough-missionary; and the chairman
of the reception committee having
assigned them seats at opposite ends of
the table, all sat down, and the annual
balloting to determine what had been the
most popular joke of the year was begun.</p>

<p>Many voted for themselves, notably the
Boston-bean joke and the Rich-plumber;
but when the votes were counted, the successful
person proved to be neither of
these, but a hideously homely woman with
a perpetual smirk upon her face.</p>

<p>“Who’s she?” asked one paragrapher
of another.</p>

<p>“You don’t know her? Why, that’s
My-face-is-my-fortune-then-you-must-be-dead-broke.”</p>

<p>And they crowned her with laurel as
unquestionably the most perennially popular
joke.</p>

THE ROUGH WORDS SOCIETY</h4>
</div>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_dct.jpg"  alt="T" /></div>

<p class="drop-cap">The other day I passed a house on
which there was a sign that read,
“The Rough Words Society.”
Curious to know what it could mean, I
retraced my steps, and met a millionaire
whom I had long admired from a distance&mdash;he
was so rich&mdash;just leaving the door.
It was a presumptuous thing to do, but I
said, “How do you do, sir?” in my best
manner. He bowed with some urbanity,
and I ventured to ask him whether he
could tell me anything about the society
whose rooms he had just left. “I thought
maybe you were president, sir, or one of
the directors.”</p>

<p>“No; I am a subscriber. If you care<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
to hear about it, come down-town with
me, as I am in a hurry,” he replied.</p>

<p>A minute later I was actually in a cab
with a millionaire! My heart beat hard,
but I kept my ears open, and he said:</p>

<p>“You see, a multi-millionaire like myself
seldom meets the frank side of people.
They are afraid of offending me,” he observed,
as we went on our way. “My
pastor hangs on my words, my clerks
speak in subdued tones, my servants
hardly dare address me; and yet, I was
once a barefoot boy, and was considered a
scapegrace by the village people who to-day
bow ceremoniously when I chance to
go back to my native place. Well, such
sycophancy becomes wearing, and I often
used to wish that some one would tell me
I lied, or some other wholesome truth.”</p>

<p>I shook my head deprecatingly, whereat
he seemed annoyed, but went on: “One
day I was passing through the street where
you met me, and I saw the sign, and, like
yours, my curiosity was excited, and I
went in. I found a room somewhat like a
telegraph-office in appearance. A very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
downright, uncompromising-looking man
sat at a roll-top desk, while ranged against
the wall were several men of exceedingly
bluff appearance. ‘Can you tell me what
the aims of your society are?’ I asked the
man. ‘Certainly I can,’ said he. ‘I
wouldn’t be here if I couldn’t.’ Not a
cringe, you see. It was refreshing.
‘Well, will you?’ ‘It depends,’ he said.
‘What do you want to know for? Are
you a reporter, or do you want to subscribe?’</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp80" id="i060" style="max-width: 25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_060.jpg"  alt="" />
</div>

<p>“I suddenly divined the purpose of the
society, and I said: ‘I want to subscribe.
What are your terms?’ ‘A hundred dollars
for a fifteen-minute séance, one hundred
and fifty dollars for a half-hour, and
two hundred dollars for a full hour.’ I
handed him a hundred-dollar bill and
said: ‘Explain.’ ‘Jack,’ said he, addressing
a bullet-headed man who was sitting
with his feet up on the railing that divided
the room into two parts, ‘give this man a
piece of your mind.’ Jack ran through a
directory of millionaires containing photographs
and short biographical sketches,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
and when he had found mine he sailed in
and talked as plainly as any one could.
Didn’t say a word that wasn’t true; but
he didn’t mince his language, and he was
no more abashed by my position in the
world than if I’d still been a barefoot boy.
It did me good. He overhauled many of
my acts during the last twenty years, and
talked to me like a Dutch uncle. Refreshed?
Why, a Turkish bath is not in it
for comfort! After he’d finished, the
manager said I could have an extra in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
way of a little billingsgate if I cared to;
but, if I was born poor, I have always had
gentlemanly instincts, and so I told him I
guessed not.</p>

<p>“As I came away, he said: ‘Glad to
have you call any time that you feel the
need of a few plain truths. We have a
minister who says what he thinks in a very
trenchant way, and I’m sure you’d be
glad to let him give you a raking over.
Here’s one of our cards. Drop in any
time you’re passing. If, for any reason,
you are not able to come, we can send a
man to take up his abode in your house,
or to give you half-hour talks from the
shoulder, and you can have a monthly account
with us. Say a good word for us
to any of your plutocratic friends who are
tired of sycophancy. Good day, old
man.’”</p>

<p>I was aghast at what he had told me,
and I said: “I wonder at his temerity!”</p>

<p>“Why,” said the millionaire, “I love
him for it! After a directors’ meeting,
when I have been kotowed to until my
gorge rises, I just drop in there, and they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
tell me unpleasant truths about myself
with the utmost freedom,&mdash;you see, they
keep posted about me,&mdash;and I come out
feeling a hundred per cent. better. Well,
here’s my office. Good day, young
man.”</p>

<p>“Good day, sir, and thank you for letting
me ride with you.”</p>

<p>He slammed the door as if vexed, and
as he approached the door of his office a
negro ran to open it, and two office-boys
took his coat and hat, and I envied the
great man from the bottom of my heart.</p>

A NEW USE FOR HORSES</h4>
</div>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_dci.jpg"  alt="I" /></div>

<p class="drop-cap">I met Scott Bindley the other
day. Scott is a great schemer.
I think he must be related on his
mother’s side to Colonel Sellers. At any
rate, there isn’t a day in the year that he
doesn’t think of some idea that should
interest capital, although capital, somehow,
fails to become interested. As soon as he
saw me he said:</p>

<p>“Got a great scheme. Small fortune
in it for the right parties.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Come into some cheap lunch-place,
and I’ll blow myself off to a meal and
give you the particulars.”</p>

<p>So it came to pass that we were soon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
seated in a restaurant which, if cheap, is
clean&mdash;a combination rarer than need be.</p>

<p>“You’ve probably noticed that the
more automobiles there are in use, the
more breakdowns there are.”</p>

<p>I could but admit that it was so.</p>

<p>“Well, what is more useless than a
broken-down motor-wagon?”</p>

<p>I would have suggested “Two,” but
Bindley hates warmed-up jokes, so I refrained
and told him that I gave it up.</p>

<p>“It isn’t a conundrum,” said he, irritably.
“Nothing in the world is more useless
than a broken-down motor. There
are some vehicles of a box-like pattern
that can be used as hen-houses when they
have outlived their initial usefulness, but
who wants a hen-house on Fifth Avenue,
corner of Twenty-fifth Street, or any other
place where a motor vehicle gives out?
The more I thought this over, the more I
felt that something was needed to make a
disabled automobile of some use, and I
saw that the man who would supply that
something could make money hand over
fist. So I devoted a great deal of time<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
to the subject, and at last I hit it.
Horses.”</p>

<p>“Horses what?” said I.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i065" style="max-width: 25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_065.jpg"  alt="" />
</div>

<p>“Why, horses to supply the motive
power. Horses are getting to be a drug
in the market, and can be bought dirt-cheap.
That being the case, I am going
to interest capitalists in the scheme, and
then we will buy up a lot of horses and
distribute them at different points in the
city. Then, when a man is out in his
automobile and breaks down, he will telephone
to the nearest station and get a
horse. This can easily be hitched to the
motor by a contrivance that I intend to
patent, and then the horse can drag the
wagon to the nearest power-house, where
it can be restocked with electricity, or gas,
or naphtha, or whatever is wanted. Isn’t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
it a great scheme? Why, sir, I can see in
the future the plan enlarged so that people
will always take a horse along with them
when they go a-motoring, and, if anything
happens, there they are with the good old
horse handy. Talk about the horseless
age! Why, horses are just entering upon
a new sphere of usefulness.”</p>

<p>I opened my mouth to speak, but he
went on: “I tell you that if I can get the
holders of automobile stock to coöperate
with me I’ll stop eating at places like
this.”</p>

<p>A look of such sweet content overspread
his features that I told him to put me
down for ten shares as soon as his company
was organized. That was a month ago,
and I haven’t gotten my stock yet. But
motors are becoming stalled every day.</p>

A CALCULATING BORE</h4>
</div>

<div>
<img class="drop-capx" src="images/i_dcm.jpg"  alt="M" /></div>

<p class="drop-capx">My friend Bings is one of those
habitual calculators&mdash;one of the
kind that says if all the teeth that
have been extracted since the first dentist
began business were to be used for paving
purposes in Hades, the good-resolutions
contractor would be out of a job for
ten thousand years. He thinks in numbers,
and if he were a minister he would
get all his texts from the same source.</p>

<p>The other day he saw me first on a
ferry-boat, and immediately buttonholed
me. Said he: “How sad it is to think
that so much labor goes for naught!”</p>

<p>I knew that I was in for one of his calculations;
but I also knew that it would
be useless to try to head him off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span></p>

<p>He stroked his beard, and said, with an
imitation of thoughtfulness:</p>

<p>“Every day in this Empire State one
million human beings go to bed tired because
you and I
and the rest leave
butter on our
plates and don’t
eat our crusts.”</p>

<div class="figleft illowe15_625" id="i068">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_068.jpg"  alt="" />
</div>

<p>I told him that
I was astonished,
but that he would
have to elucidate.</p>

<p>“The farmers
sow 8,000,000
bushels of useless
grain,&mdash;grain that
eventually goes out to sea on the refuse-scows,&mdash;they
milk 50,000 cows to no other
purpose than to produce sour or spilled
milk, they allow their valuable hens to lay
1,654,800,001 eggs that will serve no better
purpose than to spatter some would-be
Booth or lie neglected in some out-of-the-way
corner, while their wives are making
1,008,983 pounds of butter that will be left<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
on the edges of plates and thrown into the
refuse-pail. If they didn’t sow the useless
grain, or fuss over the hens that lay the unused
eggs, or draw the milk that is destined
to sour, or make the butter that is to ornament
the edges of the china disks, they
would be able to go to bed merely healthily
tired instead of overworked, and fewer
farmers would commit suicide, and fewer
farmers’ wives would go insane.”</p>

<p>His eyes gleamed, and I knew that, as he
would put it, his pulse was going so fast
that if it were revolutions of a locomotive-wheel
it would take only so long to go
somewhere.</p>

<p>“And what is your remedy for all
this?” asked I, with becoming, if mock,
interest.</p>

<p>“Let us help ourselves to no more than
we want at table, buy our eggs a week
earlier, drink our milk the day before, eat
our bread before it is too dry, and in six
months’ time there will be a reduced State
death-rate, more vacancies in the insane
asylums, 1,456,608 rosy cheeks where to-day
there are that many pale ones&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span></p>

<p>Just then the ferry-boat’s gates were
lifted, and as we went our several ways, in
the hurry that is characteristic of 7,098,111
Americans out of eight millions, I thought
that, if all the brains of all the arithmetical
cranks were used in place of wood-pulp
to make into paper, we writers would get
our pads for nothing.</p>

AN URBAN GAME</h4>
</div>

<div>
<img class="drop-capx" src="images/i_dca.jpg"  alt="A" /></div>

<p class="drop-capx">A game that is much played in
hot weather by persons who are
addicted to the department-store
habit is called “Where can I find it?”
It is played by means of counters, and its
duration is often a whole morning in
length. To the looker-on it is much like
golf, it seems so aimless; and it is aimless,
but it has the advantages over golf that it
can be played in the city and does not
necessitate the services of a caddy. Over
a score take a hand in it from first to last,
but only one is “it,” and she or he displays
the only activity necessary to the
game. Only those who are of tough
build should undertake to play it on a hot
day, as it is extremely debilitating.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span></p>

<p>To make the game long and interesting,
you should enter the store and ask for
something a little unusual that you may
have seen advertised somewhere. For instance,
you go to the glove counter and
ask for a preparation for making soup,
called “Soupina.” I am not advertising
anything, as the name is fictitious, but it
will serve to illustrate my meaning. The
particular embodiment of haughtiness at
the glove counter will think that you
mean some kind of soap, and will frigidly
direct you to the perfumery department,
“pillar No. 8.” You go there simply because
it is your move, and you repeat
your inquiry, adding that you think it’s
put up in bottles.</p>

<p>“Bottled goods,” is the quick rejoinder,
“fourth floor.”</p>

<p>The elevator bears you to the grocery
department, and you ask for “bottled
goods.”</p>

<p>“Pillar 20.”</p>

<div class="figright illowe15_625" id="i073">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_073.jpg"  alt="" />
</div>

<p>At pillar No. 20 you are made to realize
what a poor worm you are, and you turn
to pillar 10, as requested, that being the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
canned-goods department. That clerk
will undoubtedly misunderstand your order
and will direct you to the basement,
“pillar 15.” You hurry down in the elevator,
and come face to face with the
mouse-trap counter. How you go from
ladies’ underwear to carpets, to furniture,
to the telegraph-office, to the dental parlors,
to the menagerie, to the restaurant,
to the lace goods, to
every department
known to a modern
city under one roof,
you can best find out
for yourself, but of
one thing you may
be sure&mdash;you will
never find “Soupina.”</p>

<p>At last, dazed
and heated and
leg-weary, you
find yourself in
the oath-registering
room.
This is a little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
room that is in every well-equipped department-store,
and fills a long-felt want,
for all shoppers, at one time or another,
wish to register an oath. Whether you
register or not, the game is now over, and
you have lost; there is no possibility of
winning. And yet, so fascinating is the
sport that as soon as you have recovered
the use of your muscles you will be eager
to play again.</p>

“DE GUSTIBUS”</h4>
</div>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_dci.jpg"  alt="I" /></div>

<p class="drop-cap">It was on one of the cannibal islands,
and a family of cannibals
were discussing the pleasures of
the table on their front piazza while they
waited for dinner to be announced. Their
eldest daughter, a slim, acidulous-looking
girl, just home from boarding-school, and
full of fads and “isms,” had said that, for
her part, she did not care for human flesh
at all, and was of the opinion that pigs or
lambs, or even cows, would make just as
good eating as the tenderest enemy ever
captured or the juiciest missionary ever
broiled.</p>

<p>“How disgusting!” said her brother,
a lusty young cannibal who had once eaten
two Salvation Army lassies at a sitting.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
“Really, if you get such unpleasant notions
at school, it would be better for you to
stay at home. My gorge rises at the idea.
Ugh!”</p>

<p>“Papa,” said dear little kinky-haired
E. Taman, the peacemaker of the family,
changing the subject, “why are missionaries
better eating than our neighbors and
enemies?”</p>

<p>“Probably because they are apt to be
cereal-eaters,” said her father, the cannibal
chief; “although one of the most delicious
missionaries I ever tasted was a Boston lady
who had been raised on beans. She was
a Unitarian. Your Unitarians generally
make good eating. There’s a good deal
of the milk of human kindness in them,
and that makes them excellent roasters.
Now, you take a hard-shell Baptist, and
you might as well eat a ‘shore dinner’ at
once. They need a heap of steaming,
and they’re apt to be watery when all’s
said and done. But it must be confessed
they have more taste than a wishy-washy
agnostic.”</p>

<div class="figright illowe9_375" id="i077">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_077.jpg"  alt="" />
</div>

<p>“I think the most unsatisfactory of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
lot,” said his wife, “is your Presbyterian.
He’s pretty sure to be dry and gnarly, and
good for nothing but
fricasseeing. But I think
that for all-round use,
although they haven’t
the delicacy of the Unitarian,
the Methodist is
what you might call the
Plymouth Rock of missionaries.
He’s generally
fat, and he hasn’t
danced himself dry, and
he’s good for a pot-roast
or any old thing.
By the way, we’re going
to have one to-day. I must go and
tell the cook to baste him well.”</p>

<p>The old grandfather, who had hitherto
taken no part in the conversation, said at
this point: “Well, as you know, in my
day I have been something of an epicure,
and I have tasted every variety of dish
known to cannibals. I don’t care for
fresh-killed meat, no matter of what denomination
it is, and while I don’t wish to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
be considered a sectarian, yet I do think
that if you want a dish that is capable of
a good deal of trimming and fancy fixings’
get hold of an Episcopal missionary; and,
to me, the chief beauty of the Episcopalian
is that he’s apt to be a little high.”</p>

“BUFFUM’S BUSTLESS BUFFERS”</h4>
</div>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_dci.jpg"  alt="I" /></div>

<p class="drop-cap">I was looking at a rather startling
picture in the morning paper
of a man who had fallen from a
seventh-story window and had been instantly
killed. The man in the seat next
to me&mdash;we were on the elevated&mdash;said:
“I’ll do away with all those accidents
soon.”</p>

<p>I turned and looked at him. He was a
lean-faced, hollow-eyed man, full of nervous
starts, and quick of speech.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” asked I, somewhat
puzzled.</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing; oh, nothing at all,” he
replied, as if sorry he had spoken. “I do
not wish to be laughed at. I am no Keely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
motor man to be laughed at. I spoke
without thought.”</p>

<p>I fancied there was a story in him, and
so I drew him out, and he said in short,
quick sentences, but in so low a tone that
I had to strain my ears to hear him:</p>

<p>“I am Burgess Buffum, the inventor of
Buffum’s Bustless Buffers.”</p>

<p>He paused with rhetorical effect, and
nodded and blinked his eyes; and I, duly
impressed, asked him what the buffers
were supposed to buff.</p>

<div class="figleft illowe12_5" id="i081">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_081.jpg"  alt="" />
</div>

<p>“Children at open windows. Painters
on scaffolds. Panic-stricken flyers from
fires. Mountain-climbers. In fact, all
persons whose business or duty or pleasure
carries them to unsafe heights. My
buffers are filled with air, and you can’t
bust ’em. Child can fill ’em. Foot-pump,
puff, puff, puff, and there you
are. They are made of rubber and weigh
next to nothing. Painter at work on
scaffold; hears rope breaking; seizes one
of my patent buffers; holds it carelessly
in his right hand until within five feet of
the pavement; then catches it with both<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
hands, holds it in front
of him as a shield, and
falls with it under him.
Merely pleasant titillation.
Up at once;
mends rope; resumes
painting; undertaker
foiled; no funeral;
money saved; put in
bank, or invested in
stock in my company&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But,” said I, interrupting
him, “suppose
the buffer isn’t
handy?”</p>

<p>“Ah, that’s his
lookout. It must be
handy. No business
to take chances when
safeguard is on scaffolding
with him.
Or child playing on
fire-escape; careful
mother puts two of
my buffers out there;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
warns child not to fall without one; goes
about her work care-free; child feels that
it is about to fall; clutches buffer; goes
down like painter; pleasant ride; child
enjoys it; perfect confidence in my buffer;
holds it under him; arrives seated; no deleterious
effect; continues play in street.
Object-lesson in favor of my invention.
Child takes orders for my buffers; gets
commission from me. Sells dozens&mdash;”</p>

<p>Just then the guard called out, “Forty-second
Street!” and a man whom I had
not noticed before, but who wore an air
of authority, and who sat next to Buffum,
rose and, touching him on the arm, said,
“Come.”</p>

<p>And before I could get the inventor’s
address he had left the train.</p>

<p>But I fancy that</p>

<p class="pad4">Burgess Buffum, Esq.,<br />
<span class="pad6">Bloomingdale,</span></p>

<p class="noindent">will reach him.</p>

“THE FATHER OF SANTA CLAUS”</h4>
</div>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_dct.jpg"  alt="T" /></div>

<p class="drop-cap">The Successful Author dropped in
at the club and looked around
for some one to whom he might
talk shop. He spied the Timid Aspirant
in the corner, and asked him to sit down.
The Timid Aspirant blushed all over, and
felt that better days were dawning for him,
because the Successful Author’s name was
in every one’s mouth.</p>

<p>“Have much trouble to sell your stuff,
my boy?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I suppose I oughtn’t to complain.”</p>

<p>“Never destroy a manuscript, my boy.
You don’t, do you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span></p>

<p>“Sometimes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Ah, don’t. You never know when it
will become valuable. Anything written
has its niche somewhere.”</p>

<p>Then the Successful Author sank back in
his arm-chair and continued reminiscently:
“I’ll never forget how one of my articles
fared. It was the fourth or fifth thing
that I had written, and it was called ‘The
Father of Santa Claus.’ I liked it better
than any editor has ever liked anything of
mine.”</p>

<p>The Timid Aspirant nodded sympathetically,
and the Successful Author continued:
“I sent it to the ‘Prospect,’ and
it came back promptly. Did I destroy it?
Not at all. I pigeonholed it, and next
year I sent it to them again. Again
it came back, and once more I laid it to
rest for a twelvemonth, and then bombarded
the ‘Prospect’ with it. This sort
of thing went on for several years, until
at last, to save time, the editor had a
special form of rejection printed for it that
ran about as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>: The time of year has come once
more when we reject your story, ‘The Father of
Santa Claus.’ It would not seem like the sweet
Christmas season if we did not have a chance to
turn it down.</p>

<p class="right padr4">“Yours respectfully,</p>
<p class="right smcap">“Editor the Prospect.”</p>
</div>

<p>“Let you down easy each year, didn’t
he?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Well, in course of time my price
went up. At the start I’d have been tickled
to death to get five dollars for the thing,
but now I knew that if the editor ever did
change his mind I’d get at least fifty, so
I kept at it. Well, it was last year that
my collection of stories made such a hit,
and since then I’ve been so busy filling
orders for short stories that I forgot to
send my dear old mossback out this year.
But day before yesterday I received a
note from the editor of the ‘Prospect’
asking for a Christmas sketch. Now was
my opportunity. I wrote back:</p>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Sorry I haven’t anything new, but it struck
me that you might like to look at an old thing of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
mine called ‘The Father of Santa Claus,’ and if
you care to consider its publication I’ll let it go
for a couple of hundred, just for the sake of old
times.</p></div>

<p class="noindent">I inclosed the story, and just before
coming here I received a check for two
hundred dollars.”</p>

<div class="figleft illowe15_625" id="i088">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_088.jpg"  alt="" />
</div>

<p>“What moral do you deduce
from this, sir?”</p>

<p>“Don’t ever sell anything
until you’ve gotten a big
reputation.”</p>

<p>“Do you mind talking
a little more
shop?” asked the
Timid Aspirant.
Somehow he lost
his timidity when
talking to his renowned
friend.</p>

<p>“Of course not. No one really does,
though some affect to. Most talk is shop
talk. It may relate to plumbing, or to
dry-goods, or to painting, or to babies,
but it is of the shop shoppy, as a rule,
only ‘literary shop talk,’ as Ford calls it,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
is more interesting to an outsider than
the other kinds. What particular department
of our shop did you want me to
handle?”</p>

<p>“I wanted to ask you if you believed in
cutting a man’s work&mdash;in other words, do
you believe in blue-penciling?”</p>

<p>“Ah, my boy, I see that they have
been coloring your manuscript with the
hateful crayon. No, I don’t believe in it.
I dislike it now because it mars my work,
and I used to hate it because it took
money from my purse. Let me tell you
a little incident.</p>

<p>“One time, years ago, I wrote an article,
and after it was done I figured on what I
would get for it and with it. If I sold it
to a certain monthly I had in mind I
should receive enough to buy a new hat, a
new suit, a pair of shoes, ditto of socks,
and a necktie, for all of which I stood in
sore need. I hied me forth in all the
exuberance of youth and bore my manuscript
to the editor. As he was feeling
pretty good, he said he’d read it while I
waited. At last he laid it down and said:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
‘That’s a pretty good story.’ My heart
leaped like an athlete. ‘But’&mdash;my heart
stopped leaping and listened&mdash;‘it will
need a little cutting, and I’ll do it now, if
you wish.’”</p>

<p>“Poor fellow!” said the Timid Aspirant,
sympathetically.</p>

<p>“Well, the first thing that editor did
was to cut the socks off of it; then he
made a deep incision in the hat; then
he slashed away at the trousers and did
some scattered cutting, and at last handed
the manuscript to me that I might see the
havoc he had wrought in my prospective
wardrobe. Dear man, I had a vest and
a necktie left, and that was all. And it
would have been the same if it had been
a dinner.”</p>

<p>The Timid Aspirant shuddered.</p>

<p>“Many a young author has seen the
soup and the vegetables, and at last the
steak, fade away under the terrible obliterating
power of the indigo crayon, and lucky
is he if a sandwich and a glass of water remain
after the editor’s fell work. Blessed
is that editor who does not care to work<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
in pastel,&mdash;to whom the blue pencil is
taboo,&mdash;for he shall be held in honored remembrance
of all writers, and his end shall
be peace.”</p>

<p>“Amen!” said the Timid Aspirant.</p>

THE DIALECT STORE</h4>
</div>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_dci.jpg"  alt="I" /></div>

<p class="drop-cap">“I suppose I dreamed it; but if
there isn’t such a store, there
might be, and it would help quill-drivers
a lot,” said the newspaper man, as
he and his friend were waiting to give
their order in a down-town restaurant yesterday
noon.</p>

<p>“What store are you talking about, and
what dream? Don’t be so vague, old
man,” said his friend the magazine-writer.</p>

<p>“Why, a dialect store. Just the thing
for you. I was walking down Fifth
Avenue, near Twenty-first Street, and I
saw the sign, ‘Dialect shop. All kinds
of dialects sold by the yard, the piece, or
in quantities to suit.’ I thought that
maybe I might be able to get some Swe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>dish
dialect to help me out on a little story
I want to write about Wisconsin, so I
walked in. The place looked a good deal
like a dry-goods store, with counters
down each side, presided over by some
twenty or thirty clerks, men and women.</p>

<p>“The floor-walker stepped up to me and
said, ‘What can I do for you?’ ‘I want
to buy some dialect,’ said I. ‘Oh, yes;
what kind do you want to look at? We
have a very large assortment of all kinds.
There’s quite a run on Scotch just now;
perhaps you’d like to look at some of
that.’ ‘No; Swedish is what I’m after,’
I replied. ‘Oh, yes; Miss Jonson, show
this gentleman some Swedish dialect.’</p>

<p>“I walked over to Miss Jonson’s department,
and she turned and opened a
drawer that proved to be empty. ‘Are
you all out of it?’ I asked. ‘Ja; but I
skall have some to-morrer. A faller from
St. Paul he baen haer an’ bought seventy
jards.’</p>

<p>“I was disappointed, but as long as I
was there I thought I’d look around;
so I stepped to the next counter, behind<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
which stood a man who looked as if he
had just stepped out of one of Barrie’s
novels. ‘Have you Scotch?’ said I. ‘I
hae joost that. What’ll ye hae? Hielan’
or lowlan’, reeleegious or profane? I’ve
a lairge stock o’ gude auld Scotch wi’ the
smell o’ the heather on it; or if ye’re
wantin’ some a wee bit shop-worn, I’ll let
ye hae that at a lower price. There’s a
quantity that Ian Maclaren left oot o’ his
last buke.’ I expressed surprise that he
had let any escape him, and he said:
‘Hech, mon, dinna ye ken there’s no end
to the Scots?’ I felt like telling him that
I was sorry there had been a beginning,
but I refrained, and he went on: ‘We’re
gettin’ airders fra the whole English-sp’akin’
warld for the gude auld tongue.
Our manager has airdered a fu’ line of a’
soorts in anticipation of a brisk business,
now that McKinley&mdash;gude Scotch name,
that&mdash;is President.’</p>

<p>“I should have liked to stay and see a
lot of the Scotch, as it seemed to please
the man to talk about his goods; but I
wanted to have a look at all the dialects,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
so I bade him good morning, and stepped
to the next department&mdash;the negro.</p>

<p>“Here an unctuous voice called out:
‘Fo’ de Lawd! Ah don’ b’lieve you’ll
pass me widout buyin’. Got ’em all
hyah, boss&mdash;Sou’ Ca’lina an’ Ten’see an’
Virginny. Tawmas Nelson Page buys a
heap er stuff right yer. Dat man sut’n’y
got a great haid. He was de fustes’ one
ter see how much folks was dyin’ ter git a
leetle di’lect er de ra’ht sawt, an’ Ah
reckon Ah sol’ him de fus’ yard he evah
bo’t.’</p>

<p>“‘Do you sell it by the yard?’ I asked,
just to bring him out. ‘Shuah!’ and
pulling down a roll of black goods, he unrolled
enough dialect to color ‘Uncle
Tom’s Cabin.’ But I said, ‘I don’t want
to buy, uncle; but I’m obliged to you for
showing it to me.’ ‘Oh, dat’s all right,
boss. No trouble to show goods. Ah
reckon yo’ nev’ saw sech a heap er local
col’in’ as dat. Hyah! hyah! hyah! We
got de goods, an’ any tahm you want to
fix up a tale, an’ put in de Queen’s English
in black, come yer an’ as’ fer me.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
Good day, sah.’ And I passed on to the
next&mdash;Western dialect.</p>

<p>“Here I found that James Whitcomb
Riley had just engaged the whole output
of the plant. The clerk had an assistant
in his little son,&mdash;a Hoosier boy,&mdash;and he
piped up: ‘We got ’ist a littul bit er
chile’s di’lec’, an’ my popper says ’at ef
Mist’ Riley don’t come an’ git it soon ’at
I can sell it all my own se’f. ’At ’d be
the mostest fun!’ and his childish treble
caused all the other clerks in the store to
look around and smile kindly at him.</p>

<p>“In the German department the clerk
told me he was not taking orders for dialect
in bulk. ‘Zome off dose tayatree-kalers
dey buy it, aber I zell not de best
to dem. I zell imitation kints “made in
Chairmany.” Aber I haf der best eef you
vant it.’</p>

<p>“I told him I did not care to buy, and
passed on to the French-Canadian department.
The clerk was just going out to
lunch; but although I told him I merely
wished to look, and not to buy, he said
politely: ‘I try hall I can for get di’lect,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
but hup in Mon’réal dat McLennan he use
hall dere is; but bymby I speak for some
dat a frien’ have, an’ he sen’ me some.
An’ ’e tell me I’ll get hit las’ summer.’</p>

<p>“I expressed a polite wish that he might
get his goods even sooner than ‘las’ summer,’
and walked to the Jew-dialect
counter, over which I was nearly pulled
by the Hebrew clerk. ‘You’re chust in
time,’ he said. ‘Say, veepin’ Rachel!
but I sell you a parkain. Some goots
on’y been ust vun veek on der staich; unt
so hellep me cracious! you look so like
mein prudder Imre dat I let dem go’&mdash;here
he lowered his voice to a whisper&mdash;‘I
let dem go fer a qvarter uf a darler.’</p>

<div class="figleft illowe15_625" id="i098">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_098.jpg"  alt="" />
</div>

<p>“I resisted him, and hurried to the
Yankee department. There was tall hustling
going on there, and a perfect mob of
buyers of all sorts and conditions of
writers; and it took half a dozen men,
women, and children, including three typical
farmers, to wait on them; and they
were selling it by the inch and by the carload.
‘Wall, I’m plumb tired. Wisht
they’d let up so ’st I could git a snack er<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
somep’n’ inside me,’ said one; and he
looked so worn out that I passed on to
the Irish counter.
A twinkling-eyed
young Irishman,
not long over, in
answer to my question,
said: ‘Sure,
there’s not much
carl fer larrge quantities
av ut. Jane
Barlow do be havin’
a good dale, an’
the funny papers do be usin’ ut in smarl
lots, but ’t is an aisy toime I have,
an’ that’s a good thing, fer toimes is
harrd.’</p>

<p>“I paused a moment at the English-dialect
counter, and the rosy-cheeked clerk
said: ‘Cawn’t I show you the very litest
thing in Coster?’ I told him no, and he
offered me Lancashire and Yorkshire at
‘gritely reduced rites’; but I was proof
against his pleading, and having now
visited all the departments but one, went
to that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span></p>

<p>“What was it?” asked the writer for
the magazines.</p>

<p>“The tough-dialect counter.”</p>

<p>“Tough is not a dialect,” said he.</p>

<p>“Maybe not, but it sounds all right, all
right. Well, whatever it is, the fellow in
charge was a regular Ninth-Warder, and
when I got abreast of him he hailed me
with, ‘Soy, cully, wot sort d’ yer want?
I got a chim-dandy Sunny-school line er
samples fer use in dose joints, or I c’n gi’
yer hot stuff up ter de limit an’ beyon’.
See? Here’s a lot of damaged “wot t’
’ells” dat I’ll trun down fer a fiver, an’
no questions ast. Soy, burn me fer a dead
farmer if I ever sol’ dem at dat figger before;
but dey’s some dat Townsen’ did n’
use, an’ yet dey’s dead-sure winners wit’
de right gang. See?’</p>

<p>“And then I woke up, if I was asleep;
and if I wasn’t, I wish I could find the
store again, for I’d be the greatest dialect-writer
of the age if I could get goods
on credit there. Say, waiter, we came
for lunch, not supper.”</p>

“FROM THE FRENCH”</h4>
</div>

<div>
<img class="drop-capx" src="images/i_dcw.jpg"  alt="W" /></div>

<p class="drop-capx">When a Frenchman sets out to
write a tale that shall be wholly
innocuous, he succeeds&mdash;and
thereby drives his readers to seek in De
Maupassant and Zola the antidote for his
poisoning puerility.</p>

<p>He generally lays the scene in London,
that he may air his ignorance of things
foreign; and when the tale is done it contains
absolutely nothing that would bring
the blush of shame to any cheek in
Christendom, seek said cheek where you
might.</p>

<p>The following is a fair sample of the
unharmful French story. I trust that if
it had been printed without preamble or
credit, the discerning reader would have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
exclaimed, upon reading it, “From the
French!” I have called it&mdash;</p>


<p class="p2 pfs90">IT IS GOOD TO BE GOOD</p>

<p class="noindent">In the great city of London, which, as
you may know, is in England, there is a
bridge, famous throughout the whole town
as London Bridge. One dark night, many
years ago, two men started to cross it in
opposite directions, and running into each
other, their heads crashed together in the
fog which day and night envelops the city.</p>

<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Parbleu!</em>” cried one, a fellow of infinite
wealth; “but have you, then, no
better use for your head than to make of
it a battering-ram?”</p>

<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sapristi!</em>” replied the other, speaking
in the coarse tones of an English mechanic
out of work. “What matters it what I
do with it? A moment more and I shall
be in the Thames” (a large river corresponding
to our Seine, and in equal demand
by suicides). “To-night, for the first
time in my life, I commit suicide!”</p>

<p>“Why, then,” said the other, “we will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
jump together, for it is for that purpose
that I have come to this great bridge.”</p>

<p>“But,” said the mechanic, “why should
you commit suicide? I can tell by the
feeling of your garments that you are rich,
and by the softness of your head that you
are noble.”</p>

<p>“True, I am both of those things, but,
also, I have exhausted every pleasure in
life but the pleasure of suicide, and would
now try that. But you, you are a mechanic
out of work, as I can tell by your
speech. Why should you seek pleasure
instead of employment?”</p>

<p>“Alas, sir! I have at home one wife
and seventeen children, all flaxen-haired,
and all as poor as I. I cannot bear to go
home to them without even the price of a
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">biftek</i> or a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rosbif</i>.”</p>

<p>“Come,” said the nobleman; “I will
defer my sport for the night. I have
never seen a starving family. It will furnish
me with a new sensation.”</p>

<p>“Ah! but you have a kind heart, and I
will not refuse you. The river will keep.
Follow me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i103" style="max-width: 28.125em;">

</div>

<p>They followed each other through the
region of the Seven Clocks, and through
Blanc Chapel, afterward the scene of the
murders of “Jean the <span class="smcap">Ra</span>pper,” until they
came to the wretched apartment of the
poor artisan. There, huddled in the
corner of the room, were sixteen of the
starving but still flaxen-haired children.
The mother sat near the fireplace, so that
she might be near the warmth when it
came. In the other corner of the room&mdash;for
they were so poor, these people, that
they could not afford four corners&mdash;sat a
vision of beauty, aged seventeen and a
girl, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ma foi</i>! At sight of her the count’s
eyes filled with tears of compassion, and he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
handed his purse to the wretched father
and said: “My good man, do not stir
from here. I will return in an hour with
furniture!”</p>

<p>Tears of gratitude coursed down the
thirty-eight cheeks of the poor family, and
they no longer felt hungry, for they knew
that in a short time they would be sitting
upon real sofas and rocking in chairs like
those they had seen through the windows
of the rich on Holy Innocents’ Day.</p>

<p>The count, whose full title was Sir
Lord <em>E</em>rnold <span class="smcap">Ci</span>cil Judas George<span class="allsmcap">S</span> <span class="smcap">He</span>rold
<span class="smcap">Wa</span>llington, grandson of the great Lord
of <span class="smcap">Wa</span>llington, was as good as his word,
and in an hour he returned with six of his
servants, bearing sofas and cushions and
tables and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tête-à-têtes</span>, and what not.</p>

<p>The family seated themselves on the
furniture, and, clasping his knees, overwhelmed
him with thanks.</p>

<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dame! Sacré!</em>” cried he. “It is
nothing, this thing I have done. What

first time in my life I have the happiness.”
Then, turning to the father: “Give me the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
purse. I left it as a collateral. Now that
you have the furniture, you will not need
it. But that angelic being there, she shall
never weep again. I will take her with
me.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said the mother; “but that is
like you, Count <span class="smcap">Wa</span>llington. You mean
that she is to be a maid in your father’s
house? Ah! what prosperity!”</p>

<p>“Ah! do not insult the most beautiful
being who ever went about in a London
fog. She a servant? Never! I will
make her my wife. She shall be Miledi

<p>In Southwark-on-Trent, a suburb of

who they are, or whose money built the
institution?</p>

<p>And when you read in London <em><span class="smcap">Po</span>nch</em>,

ON THE VALUE OF DOGMATIC UTTERANCE</h4>
</div>

<p class="pfs90">FROM MY “GUIDE TO YOUNG AUTHORS”</p>

<div>
<img class="drop-capx" src="images/i_dcm.jpg"  alt="M" /></div>

<p class="drop-capx">My dear young reader, if you are
thinking of launching a little craft
upon the troublous sea of literature,
see that it is well ballasted with
dogmatic assertions. (I should like to
continue this nautical metaphor further, but
I am such a landlubber that I doubt if I
should be able to mix it properly, and
what interest has a metaphor if it be not
well mixed?) But to continue in plain
English: A dogmatic assertion carries
conviction to the minds of most unthinking
people&mdash;in other words, to most people.
(You and I don’t think, dear reader, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
is it likely that we are worse than the rest
of mankind?)</p>

<p>If you purpose becoming a novelist of
character, follow my directions, and your
first book will nail your reputation to the
mast of public opinion. Fill your story
full of such utterances as these: “Chaplain
Dole always nodded his head a great
many times to express affirmation. This
is a common practice with persons who
are a little hard of hearing.” (It isn’t,
and yet it may be, for all I know to the
contrary; but it will carry weight. Nine
persons out of ten will say, “Why, that’s
so, isn’t it? Haven’t you noticed it?”)</p>

<div class="figright illowe10_9375" id="i109">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_109.jpg"  alt="" />
</div>

<p>It doesn’t matter what you say; if you
say it dogmatically it will go. Thus:
“She walked with the slow, timid step
that is so characteristic of English spinsters.”
That’s a fine one, for it may
excite contradiction, and contradiction is
advertisement. Here are half a dozen
examples: “He tapped his forehead with
his left little finger, a gesture peculiar to
people who have great concentration of
mind.” “His half-closed eyes proclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
him a shrewd business man. Why is it
that your keen man of affairs should always
look out at the world through a slit?”
“The child spoke in that raucous tone
of voice that always presages cerebral
trouble.” “Miss de
Mure waved her fan
languidly, with a
scarcely perceptible
wrist motion, a sure
indication that she was
about to capitulate, but
Mr. Wroxhaemme, not
being a keen observer,
took no note of it.”
And, “He spoke but
three words, yet you
sensed that he was an
advocate. Why is it
that a lawyer cannot
conceal his profession?
A doctor may talk all day, and if he bar
shop his vocation will not be detected;
but a lawyer tunes up his vocal chords, as
it were, and the secret is out.”</p>

<p>If all the above specimens of “observa<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>tion”
were introduced into your story the
critics would unite in praising your keenness
of vision.</p>

<p>Perhaps you would like to figure as a
musical author. Few authors know anything
about music, and you don’t have to;
dogmatism and alliteration in equal parts
will take the trick. Please step this way
(as they say in the stores) and I will show
you.</p>

<p>“She played Chopin divinely&mdash;but she
did not care to clean dishes. Chopin and
care of a house do not coalesce. A girl
may love Beethoven and yet busy herself
with baking; Bach and the Beatitudes are
not antagonistic; Haydn, Handel, and
housekeeping hunt together; Schumann
and Schubert are not incompatible with
sweetness and serenity of demeanor and a
love for sewing; Mozart and Mendelssohn
may be admired and the girl will also love
to mend stockings; Weber and work may
be twins: but Chopin and cooking, Wagner
and washing, Berlioz or Brahms and basting,
Dvořák and vulgar employment&mdash;or
Dvořák and darning (according as you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
pronounce Dvořák)&mdash;are eternally at war.
So, when I have said that Carlotta was a
devotee of Chopin, I have implied that
her poor old mother did most of the
housework, while the sentimental maiden
coquetted with the keys continually.”</p>

<p>Fill your stories with such bits of false
observation, and ninety-nine persons out
of a hundred will accept them at their face-value;
which remark, being in itself a dogmatic
assertion, will doubtless carry weight
and conviction with it.</p>

THE SAD CASE OF DEACON PERKINS</h4>
</div>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_dci.jpg"  alt="I" /></div>

<p class="drop-cap">It is now some fifteen years since
the dialect story assumed undue
prominence in the literary output
of the time, and about eight since it became
a “craze.” There is no craze without
its attendant disease or ailment: thus
roller-skating developed “roller’s heel”;
gum-chewing, “chewer’s jaw”; bicycling,
the “bicycle face,” and later the “leg”;
housekeeping, “housemaid’s knee”; golf-playing,
“idiocy”; and so on, every craze
having a damaging effect upon some portion
of the anatomy. It is only within the
last year, however, that it has been discovered
that an over-indulgence in dialect<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
stories is liable to bring on an affection of
the tongue.</p>

<p>A peculiarly sad case and the most notable
that has thus far been brought to the
attention of the public is that of Deacon
Azariah Perkins of West Hartford, Connecticut.</p>

<p>Far from deploring the spread of the
dialect story, he reveled in it, reading all
the tales that he could get hold of in magazines
or circulating library. But his was
not a healthy, catholic taste; he had ears
and eyes for one dialect alone&mdash;the negro.
For him Ian Maclaren and Barrie spread
their most tempting Scotch jaw-breakers in
vain; he had no desire for them. After
fifteen years of negro dialect in every
form in which Southern and Northern
writers can serve it, any specialist in nervous
disorders could have told the deacon
that he was liable to have “negromania”;
but West Hartford does not employ
specialists, and so the stroke came unheralded,
with all the suddenness of
apoplexy.</p>

<p>Deacon Perkins has always been able to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
think standing; indeed, he has been called
the Chauncey Depew of West Hartford,
and no revival meeting or strawberry festival
or canned clam-bake was considered
a success unless the deacon’s ready tongue
took part in the exercises.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp64" id="i114" style="max-width: 18.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_114.jpg"  alt="" />
</div>

<p>Last Sunday they had a children’s festival
in the Congregational Church, and
after the children had made an end of reciting
and singing, the deacon was called
upon for a few remarks. He is a favorite
with young and old, and a man of great
purity and simplicity of character. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
arose with alacrity and walked down the
isle with the lumbering gait peculiar to
New-Englanders who have struggled with
rocky farms the best part of their lives.
He ascended the platform steps, inclined
his head to the audience, and spoke as
follows:</p>

<p>“Mah deah li’l’ chillun! Yo’ kahnd
sup’inten’ent has ast me to mek a few remahks.”
(Subdued titters on the part of
the scholars.) “Ah don’ s’pose you-all’ll
b’lieve me w’en Ah say dat Ah too was
once a li’l’ piccaninny same as yo’, but Ah
was, an’ Ah ’membeh how mah ol’ mammy
use teh tek me to Sunny-school.” (Consternation
on the part of the superintendent
and teachers.)</p>

<p>“Now, ef you-all wan’ to go to heb’n
w’en yo’ die, be ci’cumspectious ’bout de
obsarvence ob de eighth c’man’ment. Hit
ain’t so awful wicked ter steal&mdash;dat ain’t
hit, but hit’s jes nach’ly tryin’ to a man’s
self-respec’ ter git cotched. Don’ steal
jes fer deviltry, but ef yo’ is ’bleeged ter
steal, study de wedder repohts, ac’ accordin’,
an’&mdash;don’ git foun’ out&mdash;or in, eiver.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span></p>

<p>During the delivery of this remarkable
speech the deacon’s face wore his
habitual expression; a kindly light shone
in his eye, a smile of ineffable sweetness
played about his lips, and he evidently
imagined that he was begging them to
turn from their evil ways and seek the
narrow path.</p>

<p>But at this juncture Dr. Pulcifer of
New York, the eminent neurologist, who
happened to be spending Sunday in West
Hartford, whispered to the superintendent,
and on receiving an affirmative nod to his
interrogation, went up to the platform.
He held out his hand to Deacon Perkins,
who was making a rhetorical pause, and
said kindly, “Good morning, uncle.”</p>

<p>“Mornin’, sah,” said the deacon, bowing
awkwardly and scratching his head.</p>

<p>“Can you direct me to a good melon-patch?”</p>

<p>Deacon Perkins gave vent to an unctuous
negro chuckle. Then, holding up his
forefinger to enjoin caution, he tiptoed
off the platform, closely followed by the
doctor; and before nightfall he was on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
his way to a private hospital for nervous
diseases, where rest and a total abstention
from negro-dialect stories is expected
to restore him to his usual sane condition
of mind in a short time.</p>

THE MISSING-WORD BORE</h4>

<p class="drop-cap">Then, there’s that bore whose
thoughts come by freight, and
the freight is always late. You
know what’s coming, that is, you can imagine
the way-bill, but he won’t let you
help him to make better time, and runs
his train of thought as if it were on a heavy
grade.</p>

<p>He starts to tell a story, blinking his
red eyes, meanwhile, as if he thought that
they supplied the motive power for his
tongue. To make listening to him the
harder, he generally tells a very old story.</p>

<p>“One day, William Makepeace&mdash;er-er&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Thackeray,” you say, intending to
help him. Of course it is Thackeray, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
he was going to tell about the novelist and
the Bowery boy; but he is so pig-headed
that he shifts on to another track.</p>

<p>“No; Dickens, Charles Dickens. One
day, when Charles Dickens was at work
on ‘Bleak’&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;”</p>

<p>“‘Bleak House’?” you say.</p>

<p>“No!” he snaps; “‘Dombey and Son.’
One day, when Charles Dickens was at
work on ‘Dombey and Son,’ he was approached
by his biographer, John&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Forster?”</p>

<p>“No; it wasn’t
his biographer,
either; it was
Edmund Yates.”</p>

<p>You now take
a gleeful pleasure
in seeing how
hopelessly you
can make him
tangle himself up
by the refusal of
your help, but
he doesn’t care.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
He’ll tell it in his own words, though
the heavens fall and though he starts a
hundred stories.</p>

<p>“Charles Dickens had a very loud way
of&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Dressing?”</p>

<p>“No, no! He had a loud way of talking,
and he and Edmund&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yates?”</p>

<p>“No, sir; Edmund Spenser.”</p>

<p>Of course this is arrant nonsense on the
face of it, but he won’t admit that he’s
made pi of his story, and he goes on:</p>

<p>“Edmund said that Charles&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Dickens?”</p>

<p>“No, sir; Charles Reade. Edmund
said that Charles Reade thought George&mdash;er&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Meredith?”</p>

<p>“No; hang it all! George Eliot. He
thought that George Eliot never wrote a
better book than ‘Silas’&mdash;er&mdash;”</p>

<p>“‘Marner’?”</p>

<p>“Not at all! ‘Silas Lapham.’”</p>

<p>Now, if you are merciful, or if you are
refinedly cruel, either one, you will allow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
him to finish his story in peace, and, like
as not, he will start all over again by saying:
“I guess I inadvertently got hold
of the wrong name at the beginning. It
was not Dickens, as you said, but Thackeray.
Thackeray was one day walking
along the Bowery when he met a typical&mdash;”
And so on to the bitter end.</p>

THE CONFESSIONS OF A CRITIC</h4>
</div>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_dci.jpg"  alt="I" /></div>

<p class="drop-cap">I met a prominent literary critic
the other evening. A review
signed with his name or even
with his initials is apt to make or mar the
work treated therein.</p>

<p>Now, I have not a little hypnotic
power, and the mischievous idea came
into my head to hypnotize him and make
him “confess.”</p>

<p>We were sitting in the reading-room of
an up-town club. I led the conversation
to the subject of hypnotism, and soon
gained the critic’s consent to be put into a
trance.</p>

<p>I did not influence him any more than
to put his mind in the attitude of truthfully
answering what questions I might ask him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span></p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Which do you prefer to criticize, a
book that has already been reviewed or
one that is perfectly fresh?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Oh, one that has been reviewed,
and the oftener the better. I thus gain
some idea of the trend of critical opinion
and shape my review accordingly.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Do you ever run counter to the
general sentiment?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Yes; if I find that a book has been
damned with faint praise, I sometimes
laud it to the skies and thus gain a reputation
for independence that is very useful
to me. Or if a book has been heralded
by the best critics of both countries as
“the book of the year,” I sometimes pick it
to pieces, taking its grammar as a basis, or
some other point that I think I can attack
without injury to my reputation for discernment,
and again I score a victory for
my independence.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Why don’t you like to be the first
to review a new book?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> For the same reason that most
critics hate to&mdash;unless, indeed, they are
just out of college and are cock-sure of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
everything. I fear that its author may
be one of the numerous coming men. I
may be entirely at sea about the book. I
prefer to get some idea of <ins class="corr" id="tn-124" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'what the concensus'">
what the consensus</ins> of the best
opinion is.</p>

<div class="figleft illowe14_0625" id="i124">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_124.jpg"  alt="" />
</div>

<p><em>Q.</em> Then you do
not consider your
own the best opinion?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> No; no one
critic’s opinion is
worth much.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Can you tell
an author by his
style?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Always, if I know who he is before
I begin to read. But it is hazardous work
to say such-and-such a work is by such-and-such
a man unless there are internal
evidences aside from the style. Once a
book was sent to me for criticism. Before
I opened it I lent it to a waggish friend
of mine, and he returned it next day. I
looked at the title-page, saw that it was by
an absolutely unknown man and that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
scene was laid in India, and, of course, I
felt safe in giving it fits on the principle
that Rudyard Kipling is not likely to be
equaled in this generation as a depicter
of Indian life. Well, I said that it was
painfully crude and amateurish; that it
might do for the “Servants’ Own,” but
was not a book for ladies and gentlemen;
that it had absolutely no style or local coloring;
that the scene might as well have
been laid in Kamchatka; and that it was
marked by but one thing, audacity, for the
author had borrowed some of Kipling’s
characters&mdash;to the extent of the names
only. In short, I had fun with that book,
for I knew that my fellow-critics would
with one accord turn and rend it. By
mere chance I didn’t sign it.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> And who had written the book?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Why, Kipling. My friend had cut
another name out of a book and had pasted
it so neatly over Kipling’s wherever his
occurred that I was, of course, taken unawares.
You can’t bank on style. Look
how positive people were Mark Twain had
not written “Jeanne d’Arc.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span></p>

<p>I here interrupted the flow of his conversation
to say: “Your experience is not
unlike that of the reviewer who criticized
‘Silas Lapham,’ and who had a sort of hazy
notion from the similarity of titles that it
was by the author of ‘Silas Marner.’ You
may remember, it created a good deal of
amusement at the time. He said that it
was a mistake for George Eliot to try
to write a novel of American life; that
the vital essence&mdash;American humor&mdash;was
lacking; that Silas Lapham was a dull
Englishman transplanted bodily into a
very British Boston; that his daughters
were mere puppets, and the attempts at
Americanisms doleful in the extreme.
He concluded by saying that her ‘Romola’
had shown that she was best on British
soil, and that she would better keep to the
snug little isle in the future.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said he, with a grin; “I remember
that. It was my first criticism.
Most people supposed it was a humorous
skit, even the editors who accepted it, but
I never was more in earnest. I was young
then.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span></p>

<p><em>Q.</em> If you received a book to review
with the name of Hardy on the title-page,
would you give it a good send-off?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> I certainly should, for I am a great
admirer of Hardy; but I should prefer to
wait until some one else had done so, for
fear it might be another put-up job and
turn out to be the work of some fifth-rate
English author.</p>

<p>I then brought him out of his trance.
He sat silent for a moment. I picked up
the “Saturday Review” from the table
and said, “Criticism is a very noble calling.”</p>

<p>“It is indeed,” he responded earnestly.
“It is one that requires great insight into
human nature, absolute independence, and
not a little charity.”</p>

<p>With which beautiful sentiments he
rose and, bowing, left the room.</p>

Uncle ’Rasmus, an aged darky,
singing one of the songs of his race that
never grow old&mdash;because they die young,
it may be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span></p>

<p>As he hobbled along the path, he talked
to himself, as was his wont:</p>

<p>“Golly! Ah mus’ hurry up, o’ de fo’kses

<p>Just then his watch struck five minutes
to six, and he ran off toward the homestead
of Squire Lamar, saying, as he did
so, in his quaint way: “Veepin’ Rachel!
der boss will kick der live out mit me.”</p>

<p>Before the war Squire Lamar had been
the richest man in Oconee County; but
the conflict had ruined him, and he now
had little except his plantation, horses,
and stables. He lived in his ancestral
house, which was heavily mortgaged, with
his wife and children.</p>

<p>’Rasmus, his only servant, an ex-slave,
supported the family by collecting dollars&mdash;at
night.</p>

<p>As he ran toward the house, he saw
Squire Lamar on the veranda. Just then
a horseman dashed up. He was the
sheriff of Oconee County. ’Rasmus took<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
advantage of the commotion, and ran into
the kitchen to cook the dinner. On seeing
the squire, the sheriff called out to
him: “The mortgage on this place will
be foreclosed if the $3600 due is not
forthcoming by to-morrow noon.”</p>

<p>“Alas!” said the squire; “you see how
we are situated. I haven’t a dollar, and
wouldn’t know how to earn one if I had.”</p>

<p>At this juncture, ’Rasmus, who had
cooked the dinner during the conversation,
came up and said: “Massa, Ah’s a free
man, Ah know Ah is; but avick, ’t is a
mighty shmall wan Oi’d be if I wouldn’t
help out a poor omadhaun like yerself.
‘Caed mille fail the Bryn Mawr dolce far
niente.’ Zat ees mon motto, an’ so, deah
massah, I will guarantee to git de money
by to-morrow noon.” Then turning to
the sheriff, he said in a manly tone that
contrasted ill with his ragged garments:
“Ye maun fash awee, laddie, doon the
skim.”</p>

<p>After a few more words, the sheriff,
who was really a kind man at heart, rode
off, saying he would be on hand the next<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
day, and if the money were not forthcoming,
he would march them all off to the
county jail, ten miles distant. After blowing
the dinner-horn, ’Rasmus hobbled off
to his humble cottage.</p>


<p class="p2 center">II</p>

<p>On arriving at his cabin, ’Rasmus took a
bolster-case full of dollars from under the
bed, and proceeded to count them. There
were just $3000. “Now, Ah mus’ git
$600 more before to-morrow, or else me
poor masther’ll be wor-r-rkin’ in the
chain-gang. Ach, Himmel!” said the
good old darky, his eyes suffused with
tears, “if dot took blace, it zeems as if
mein herz would break.”</p>

<p>He calmly decided on a plan of action,
however. Waiting until night had flung
over the earth a pall, through which the
silvery moon cast shimmering beams aslant
the quivering aspens of the forest, and the
snoring of the birds told him that nature
slept, he left his house and walked briskly
off to the highway.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span></p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_132.jpg"  alt="" />
</div>

<p>About that time a lawyer was riding
along the road on horseback, with a wallet
containing a share of an estate worth $600,
which he had secured for an old woman.</p>

<p>’Rasmus saw the traveler, saw the
horse, saw the wallet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span></p>

<p>The traveler saw no one. He was
blind&mdash;drunk.</p>

<p>’Rasmus cut a stout bludgeon.</p>

<p>The traveler ambled on.</p>

<p>’Rasmus clasped the bludgeon.</p>

<p>The traveler continued to amble.</p>

<p>’Rasmus stole up beside him....</p>

<p>The traveler lay in the ditch.</p>

<p>’Rasmus jumped on the horse, the wallet
in his hand, and galloped home, stabling
the beautiful animal in his cabin to
avoid being suspected of the murder.</p>

<p>Placing his shoe in front of the one window
of the cabin, that none might see him,
he counted the money, and found it
amounted to just $600, which, together
with the $3000, formed the sum required
by the sheriff. This made him so happy
that he picked up a banjo and played
Wagner’s “Götterdämmerung” through
once or twice, accompanying himself on
his throat in a rich tenor. He then turned
out the gas and retired, to sleep as only a
good, unselfish soul can.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span></p>


<p class="p2 center">III</p>

<p>It is 11:45 <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span> The squire and his
family, who have heard nothing from
’Rasmus, are on the veranda, anxiously
awaiting the arrival of the sheriff.</p>

<p>11:50 <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span>! Is ’Rasmus dead? Has
the sheriff relented?</p>

<p>11:55. Good lack! The sheriff is
seen galloping toward the house, and yet
there is no sign of ’Rasmus.</p>

<p>That individual, who is nothing if not
dramatic, is sitting behind the house on
horseback, awaiting the stroke of twelve.</p>

<p>The door of the ormolu cuckoo-clock in
the kitchen opens, the cuckoo advances.
At her first note the sheriff jumps from
his horse; at the second he walks sternly
upon the veranda; at the third he asks
for the money; at the fourth and fifth
they tell him that ’Rasmus has disappeared;
at the sixth, seventh, and eighth
he handcuffs them all together; at the
ninth, tenth, and eleventh he jumps on his
horse and rides off, dragging them behind<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
him; and at the twelfth ’Rasmus trots
leisurely out from behind the house, and,
opening a carpet-bag, counts out $3600
in silver!</p>

<p>The astonished sheriff puts the money
into his pocket, gives Squire Lamar a receipt
in full for it, unlocks the handcuffs,
and the family resume their wonted places
on the veranda.</p>

<p>But all was not yet done. ’Rasmus
still had his bludgeon with him, and a few
deft strokes on the sheriff’s head were all-sufficient.
’Rasmus then took back the
money and gave it to Squire Lamar.
Then he told them all to remain perfectly
still, and whistling three times, an amateur
photographer made his appearance, adjusted
his apparatus, and took their pictures.</p>

<p>Sarony could have wished for no better
subjects. On the broad veranda lay
the old lady prone on the floor, reading
the “Tallahassee Inland Mariner”; at her
side sat her daughter, Turk-fashion, shelling
a pea; while the son and heir reclined
near by, reading an account by a Prussian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
officer of the third battle of Bull Run.
The father, weighted down with dollars,
snored in the background.</p>

<p>And beaming on them all with the consciousness
of having done his best and
done it well, old ’Rasmus stood, singing
ventriloquially, so as not to injure the picture,
this negro plantation song:</p>

’MIDST ARMED FOES</h4>

“SARAH THE SALES-WOM-LADY; OR,
FROM COUNTER TO COUNTESS,” ETC.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">Raoul Chevreuilly stood
within a rude hut in the dark recesses
of the forest of Fontainebleau.
By his side stood his lady-love,
the beautiful Perichole Perihelion. Without,
the night was black and the wind
roared as it is wont to do in stories of this
type.</p>

<p>“Dost fear aught, my precious?” asked
Raoul, gazing at the French face of the
lovely Parisian.</p>

<p>“Why should I fear when I am pro<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>tected
by my Raoul&mdash;how do you pronounce
Raoul, anyway?” replied she.</p>

<p>“I long ago gave up trying. But,
Perichole, while I would not have you fear,
yet it is no light task that I have undertaken&mdash;your
defense against as fierce a
pack of roistering thieves as ever beset
the forest and who now surround this
hut. Let but the wind die down so that
they may be heard, and they will hurl execrations
at me and beat down the door.
Réné Charpentier seeks my life because I
have promised to be yours, or rather because
you have promised to be mine.
But he shall kill me only at the expense
of my life. Yea, though he had twice a
hundred myrmidons at his back and beck.”</p>

<p>For answer the entrancing girl took a
mother-of-pearl jews’ harp off the wall and
played “Mlle. Rosie O’Grady,” “There’ll
be a chaud temps in the vieux ville ce
soir,” and other simple French ditties.</p>

<div class="figright illowe15_625" id="i139">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_139.jpg"  alt="" />
</div>

<p>Instead of admiring her pluck, Raoul
was moved to fury, and he cried in French,&mdash;this
whole business is supposed to be in
French, except the descriptions,&mdash;“Is it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
impossible to move you to a realization of
my bravery? Know, then, that, save for
ourselves, there is not a human being
within three miles
of this hut. I had
thought that you
would be moved to
added love by such
an exhibition of
bravery on my part
as your defense
against a hundred
bravos; but, <em>viol di
gamba!</em> you have
no imagination.”</p>

<p>“And Réné
Charpentier?”</p>

<p>“There is no
such fellow. He is but a pigment&mdash;I mean
figment of my brain.”</p>

<p>Flinging a pair of arms around his
French neck, the adorable Perichole kissed
Raoul again and once more. Then she
said, “My adored one, that you were
brave I suspected&mdash;are you not the hero
of a French novel? But I never knew<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
that you were such a lovely liar. Raoul,
my own forevermore!”</p>

<p>And her beautiful face beamed with a
love-light whose wick had been newly
trimmed.</p>

Buttercups bespangled the grass

<p>On the front stoop of an old baronial

the roadway that led to
Churchill Hall, the home
of the Churchills for
seven centuries. Her
right cheek was overflushed,
and ever and
anon she bit her chin.
England could boast
of no prettier girl
than Godiva, nor did
England boast
of it as much
as Godiva did.</p>

The as yet colorless

The buttercups fled long ago with the apple-blossoms,

and I cannot spell the name of the place

and waiting to be drawn into the plot of
my story. Patient man!</p>

<p>Godiva Churchill Churchill, of Churchill

in the saddle, filled with vague longings.</p>

<p>Purple asters fringe the highways of
New England, and rosy apples depend
from the boughs in countless orchards. (I
think that scenery is my strong point.)</p>

<p>Godiva Churchill Churchill, of Churchill

her incessant cantering upon the graveled
paths of Churchill Hall. She is beginning
to feel resentment at me for the enforced
monotony of her existence, but heavens!
how can I help it? I’m trying my level
best to evolve a plot.</p>


<p class="p2 center">IV</p>

<p>The flowers that gladdened the meads
and highways and shady lanes of New
England are gone. Winter’s robes of
office are thrown carelessly over the landscape,
and apples in innumerable barrels
stand in the cellars, waiting for better
prices.</p>

<p>The reason why I have so faithfully
described New England scenery is because
that’s the only kind of scenery I know
anything about.</p>

<p>I am ashamed to confess it, but this is

of any good reason for the departure of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
Armand Maria Sylvestre de Faience
Pomade Pommedeterre from the south of
France. He can’t speak a word of English,
and if you’re thinking of Godiva, she
can’t speak a syllable of French.</p>

<p>Poor Godiva Churchill Churchill, of
Churchill Wolde, Biddecumb on Baddecumb!
She is quite lame from her long-continued
exercise in the saddle, but still
canters aimlessly about. She has become
the laughing-stock of all the tenants of
Churchill Wolde, and it’s all my fault.</p>

<p>If she saw Armand she’d fall in love
with him, but I can’t think of a way to
bring about their meeting. That’s what
it is to lack invention.</p>

A SCOTCH SKETCH</h4>
</div>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_dct.jpg"  alt="T" /></div>

<p class="drop-cap">The shadows lengthened on old
Ben Nevis. Surely none of my
readers imagines that Ben Nevis
is the hero of my simple Scotch sketch.
If so, he is awa off. Ben Nevis is a mountain,
and I have flung it in as a suitable
background for the following conversation:</p>

<p>“Mither, mither, ye’ll mek nae doot o’
haein’ roast beef fer supper,” said Hillocks
Kilspindie, as he sat on the old bench
in front of their cottage door.</p>

<p>With a troubled look, his mother, old
Margaret Kilspindie, replied: “Man, Hillocks,
div ye no see me buyin’ the haggis?”</p>

<p>“Yes, mither; but I’m sair sick o’
haggis. Syne Scotch literatoor kem in
it’s hard put we are to live at all. I say<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
may the plague take Maclaren and Barrie
and Crockett. Before they began to
write”&mdash;and in his excitement Hillocks
was using as good English as any other
Scotchman in real life&mdash;“roast beef and
wheat bread and chops and tomato-sauce
and other Christian dishes were good
enough for us all. Then came the influx
of Americans who wanted to see the
scenes made immortal by the ‘Bonnie
Brier Bush’ (I wish Ian might have
scratched his writing-hand upon it) and
the ‘Window in Thrums’ (which I wish
some one had broken before Barrie saw
it), and now it is haggis in the morning,
and haggis at noon, and haggis at
night, and Scotch dialect that tears my
tongue to pieces all the time.”</p>

<p>“Hech, my bairnie; but thae are wrang
words, an’ fu’ o’ unchristian bitterness.”</p>

<p>“Oh, mother! drop your ‘hechs’ and
your ‘fu’s.’ There are no Americans
about this evening. It’s hard enough to
talk the abominable gibberish when we
have to, without keeping it up all the
time. But, tell me, mother, couldn’t you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
smuggle in a little roast beef to-night, and
let me eat in the cellar?” And a pleading
look came into the young man’s eyes
that was hard to resist.</p>

<p>“My bairn&mdash;I mean my boy, I’d like
to, but I dare not. Maclaren’s inspectors
are due here any minute, and I could ill
afford to pay the heavy fine that would be
levied if we were found with as English a
thing as roast beef in the house. No, lad,
we maun stick to parritch and haggis&mdash;I
mean we must stick to oatmeal and haggis.”</p>

<p>Just then the sentry that was stationed
at the outskirts of the village to warn the
villagers of the approach of Americans
gave the laugh of warning: “H-O! H-O!
H-O!” And, with a bitter look on his
face, and a shake of his fist in the direction
of Loch Lomond, Ben Nevis, Ben
Bolt, and various other bits of Scotch
scenery that were scattered about, Hillocks
Kilspindie said to his mother: “Weel,
as surees deith a’ c’u’dna help it; tae be
sittin’ on peens for mair than twa oors,
tryin’ tae get a grup o’ a man’s heads. (I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>

it a looloo?)”</p>

<p>“(Indeed it is, my son. Look out!
The Americans are almost within ear-shot.)
Noo we’ve tae begin an’ keep it up till

EPHRATA SYMONDS’S DOUBLE LIFE</h4>
</div>


<p class="center">I</p>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_dce.jpg"  alt="E" /></div>

<p class="drop-cap">Ephrata Symonds was a
knave. Of that there was no
doubt. It stuck out all over
him. His face was a chart of wickedness,
and it was his open boast that he had never
done any good in his life, and, please the
devil, he never intended doing any. He
had married early in life (in a fit of absent-mindedness),
but he had long since forsaken
his wife and children.</p>

<p>“Satan finds some mischief still for idle
hands to do”; but, to speak in a paradox,
Satan never gave him any employment,
for he was ever busy&mdash;at evil. It was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
when he was just turned fifty that he was
elected a member of the Evil-doers’ Club.
He soon became popular, and upon the
incarceration of the president of the club,
the trusted cashier of the Tyninth National
Bank, Symonds was unanimously elected
president in his place.</p>

<div class="figleft illowe14_0625" id="i154">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_154.jpg"  alt="" />
</div>

<p>That he was the right man for the position
he immediately proved by presenting
the club with a fine new club-house, which
he assured them was not his to give, or he
would not have presented it. In the first
six months of his presidency he eloped
with two married women at once, and so
managed the trip
that neither suspected
that she was
not quite alone in
his company. He
deserted them both
in the West, and
returned to pose
before his fellow
club-members. He
diverted to his use
the little property<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
of a friendless woman, and in many characteristic
ways showed himself to be thoroughly
bad.</p>

<p>It was at this period of his life that his
death came, and his last words were: “I
am thankful that no man is the better for
my having lived.”</p>

<p>His fellow Evil-doers mourned his departure
with sincerity. They felt that in
losing such a thoroughly bad man they had
suffered a loss which it would be impossible
to repair. As the secretary feelingly
put it, “Hell is the worse for having him.”
“Yes,” said another; “he was admirably
bad. And it is the more to his credit that
he was bad in spite of adverse influences.
His parents were pious people, and
Ephrata had every temptation to lead a
life of virtue; but in the face of all the obstacles
that his father put in the way of his
becoming vicious, he persevered, and yesterday
I had the honor of telling his old
mother that her son was undoubtedly the
most wicked man in New York. It made
quite an impression on her. We shall
ne’er see his like again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span></p>

<p>The parlors of the Evil-doers’ Club were
draped in black, and mock resolutions of
sympathy were sent to his deserted wife.</p>


<p class="p2 center">II</p>

<p>Great was the chagrin of the members
of the club when it began to be bruited
among them that Symonds had been leading
a double life; that his wickedness was
but a cloak to hide his goodness. The
rumors were at first pooh-poohed, but
when it was remembered that every third
week he had always absented himself from
town, the story that he was really a good
man began to wear an air of truth. Detectives
were set to work, and the damning
proofs of his deceitful goodness multiplied
rapidly, and at last the facts came
out, but only to the club-members. They
felt that it would not be creditable to allow
such scandalous stories to be repeated to
the world at large, which would only too
willingly point the finger of scorn at them
on learning that their chief officer had, in
spite of every lure, gone right. Some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
might even go so far as to insinuate that
maybe other members were better than
they seemed to be. No; Symonds’s disreputable
goodness should continue to be as
well cloaked as he had cloaked it while alive.</p>

<p>The story of his goodness is as follows:
It seems that every third week of his life
had been spent in Boston, and while there
he had earned a large income as a life-insurance
agent. It was his wont to spend
this money in doing good. Nothing was
known in the Hub of his private life. He
lived at the Adams House, and cultivated
an austerity of manner that repelled people;
but by underhand means he contrived to
ameliorate a deal of misery.</p>

<p>Having become convinced in his early
youth that unostentatious benevolence
was preferable to a life of good works
blazoned forth to an admiring world, he
had habituated himself to every form of
vice, in order, under cover of it, to pursue
unobserved the efforts he was to put forth
for the good of his fellow-men. And he
had well succeeded. When Elias Hapgood,
who had for thirty years subsisted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
on the bounty of an unknown benefactor,
read in the Boston “Herald” an account of
the death of Ephrata Symonds, “the
wickedest man in New York,” he breathed
a prayer of thankfulness that the world
was rid of such a man, little knowing that
he was misjudging his best friend. And
Elias was but one of scores that had been
similarly benefited. Symonds’s charities
had been literally endless and invariably
anonymous. And now, after having, as
it were, lived down his good works, it was
a little hard that death should have torn
from him the lifelong mask of deceit, and
set him before his fellow-members for what
he was&mdash;a thoroughly good man.</p>


<p class="p2 center">III</p>

<p>It was a special business meeting of the
Evil-doers’ Club. The chairman rapped
for order, and the secretary read the following
resolutions:</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Whereas</span>, It has pleased Nature to
take from among us Ephrata Symonds, for
some time our honored president;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span></p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Whereas</span>, We had always supposed
him to be a man of the most exemplary
wickedness, a man before whom all Evil-doers
might well hide their diminished
heads in despair of ever approaching his
level of degradation;</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Whereas</span>, His life had always seemed
to us a perfectly unbroken and singularly
consistent chain of crimes and enormities
to be emulated by us all; and</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Whereas</span>, It has lately come to be
known that his wickedness was but a mask
to hide a life of well-doing, occupied in
its every third week with deeds of kindness
and generosity;</p>

<p>“Therefore be it <em>Resolved</em>, That we, as
members of this club, have been most
shamefully imposed upon;</p>

<p>“<em>Resolved</em>, That we hereby express our
contempt for a man who, with every incentive
to be always bad, should have so far
forgotten himself as to lead a third of a
worthy life.”</p>

<p>The secretary had not finished reading
the resolutions when a messenger brought
in a letter which he handed to the chair<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>man
as the clock pointed to eight fifty-eight.</p>

<p>It ran in this fashion:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Fellow-Members</span>: It is, by the time of reading
this, probably plain to you that you have been
taken in by me, and that, so far from my really
having been a wicked person, I was a credit to my
race and time.</p>

<p>True to my desire that to the rest of the world I
should be accounted a bad man, I have caused to
be delivered with this letter a box. It works its
purpose at nine o’clock. Sit where you are and do
not attempt to escape. The secret of my goodness
rests, and shall rest, with you.</p>

<p class="pad2">Yours insincerely, <span class="smcap pad2">Ephrata Symonds</span>.</p></div>

<p>As the chairman finished reading he
glanced at the clock. It was on the
stroke of nine! He seized the box, and
with a wild cry attempted to throw it
through the window, but it was too late.
A whirring noise was heard, followed by a
terrific explosion, that left of club-house and
-members naught save a hole in the ground.</p>

<p>Symonds’s culpable goodness remained
unknown to the world.</p>

A STRANGER TO LUCK</h4>
</div>

<div>
<img class="drop-capx" src="images/i_dcw.jpg"  alt="W" /></div>

<p class="drop-capx">When I got off the train at Darbyville,
which, as all will remember,
is the junction of the L. M. &amp; N.
and O. P. &amp; Q. railroads, and found that,
owing to an accident, it would be an hour
before the train came in on the latter road,
I was vexed. Although ordinarily my
own thoughts are agreeable companions,
yet events of the past week, in which my
good judgment had not borne a conspicuous
part, made it likely that for the nonce
these thoughts of mine would be more or
less unpleasant, and so I cast about for
some human nature to study.</p>

<p>At one end of the platform three or four
farmers were seated upon trunks. They<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
were alert-looking men, and, like me, were
waiting for the train. As I neared them,
one of their number, a tall, lanky, sharp-boned,
knife-featured fellow, imperturbably
good-natured-looking, and with an
expression of more than ordinary intelligence
in his eyes, left them and sauntered
off down the road with long, irregular
strides.</p>

<p>It was one of those calm, clear, dry days
when sounds carry well, and although I
did not join them, yet I heard every word
of the conversation. Indeed, as their
glances from time to time showed, they
were not averse to having an auditor.</p>

<p>“It’s cur’us,” said one of them, a
ruddy-faced man with a white beard, “how
unlucky a man c’n be an’ yit manage to
live.” His eyes followed the shambling
figure that had just left them. “I’ll help
myself to some of thet terbacker, Jed.
Left mine to hum, an’ I have the teethache&mdash;awful.”
This to a short, stout man
with a smooth face, who had just taken a
liberal mouthful of tobacco from a paper
that he drew from his hip-pocket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span></p>

<p>“He’p ’se’f!” said the one addressed.
Then he added, “Meanin’ Seth, I s’pose?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the other. “I b’lieve
thet ef Seth was to hev anythin’ really
fort’nit happen to him, it would throw him
off his balance.”</p>

<p>“’N’ yit ther’ never was a feller thet
better deserved good luck than Seth.
Most obligin’ man I ever saw. Ain’t no
fool, nuther,” remarked the third and last
member of the group, a typical Uncle Sam
in appearance, with prominent front teeth,
and a habit of laughing dryly at everything
that he or any one else said.</p>

<p>“He don’t suffer fer the actooal needs
of life, doos he?” asked the stout man
whom the others called Jed.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;oh, no,” answered Sam (for it
turned out that so the typical Yankee was
called). “No; he gits enough to eat and
wear, but he never hez a cent to lay by,
and never will.”</p>

<p>“Don’t drink, doos he?” asked Jed,
who seemed to belong to a different town
from the one wherein the others and Seth
abode. His acquaintance with the one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
under discussion was evidently by no means
intimate.</p>

<p>“No; he ain’t got no vices ’t I know of.
Jes’ onlucky.”</p>

<p>“It’s s’prisin’ haow tantalizin’ly clus
good fortin hez come to him&mdash;different
times,” said the one who had asked for the
tobacco, and whom the others called Silas.</p>

<p>“You’re <em>right</em>, Silas,” assented Sam.
“He c’n come nearer to good luck ’thout
techin’ it ’an any man I ever see.”</p>

<p>“Don’t seem to worrit him much,” said
Jed. “He seems cheerful.”</p>

<p>“Don’t nothin’ worrit <em>him</em>,” Sam continued.
“Most easy-goin’ man on the face
of the airth. <em>He</em> don’t ask fer sympathy.
He takes great doses of bad luck ’s ef
’twas good fer his health.”</p>

<p>“Never fergit,” said Silas, “the time
when he bought a fine new milch Jarsey
at auction fer five dollars. Why, he hed
two offers fer her nex’ day, an’ I <em>know</em> one
of ’em was forty dollars&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Well, naow I call that purty lucky,”
interrupted Jed.</p>

<p>“Wait!” continued Silas, seating him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>self
more comfortably on a trunk. “Seth
he wouldn’t sell. Said he never did hev
his fill of milk, an’ he was goin’ to keep
her. Very nex’ day, b’ George! she
choked on a turnip, an’ when
he faound her she was cold.
Man sympathized with him.
‘Too bad, Seth,’ says he;
‘ye ’r’ aout forty dollars.’
‘Five’s all I figger it at,’
says Seth. ‘Didn’t <em>keer</em> to
sell.’</p>

<div class="figright illowe7_8125" id="i165">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_165.jpg"  alt="" />
</div>

<p>“Closest call ’at fortune
ever made him was time his
uncle Ralzemon aout West
died and left him $5000.
Everybody was glad, fer
every one likes Seth. I was
with him when he got the
letter f’om the lawyer
sayin’ it was all in gold,
an’ hed be’n expressed to him, thet bein’
one of the terms of the will. Mos’ shif’less
way of sendin’ it, I thought,” declared
Silas, compressing his lips. “‘What ye
goin’ to do with it, Seth?’ says I. ‘Put<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
it in the bank?’ ‘Ain’t got it yit,’ says
he; ‘an’, what’s more, I never will.’
‘Why d’ ye think so?’ says I. ‘On
gin’al principles,’ says he, a-laafin’.</p>

<p>“Sure ’nough, a few days later it was
printed in the paper thet a train aout in
Wisconsin hed be’n held up by robbers.
I was in the post-office when I saw it in
the paper, an’ Seth was there too. ‘Bet
ye a cooky thet my $5000 was on thet
train,’ says he. ‘Won’t take ye,’ says I;
‘fer I’ll bet ye five dollars ’twas, myse’f.’
‘I’ll take ye,’ says he. B’ George! he
lost the five and the $5000 too, fer <em>’twas</em>
on the train, an’ they never could git a
trace of it. The robbers hed took to the
woods, an’ they never found ’em.”</p>

<p>“Well, I swan!” ejaculated Jed, chewing
hard, and regarding with ominous look
a knot-hole in the platform.</p>

<p>Silas continued: “I says, ‘I’m sorry
fer ye, Seth.’ Says he: ‘I ain’t no poorer
’an I was before I heard he’d left it to
me.’”</p>

<p>“He was aout the five dollars he bet,
though,” said Jed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span></p>

<p>“Wa’n’t, nuther,” said Silas, rather
shamefacedly. “I told him thet the bet
was off.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t he sue the comp’ny?”
asked Jed.</p>

<p>“’At’s what I advised him doin’, but
he said ’twa’n’t no use.”</p>

<p>“I think I heard ’baout his havin’ a
fortin left him at the time, but I thought
it was f’om a cousin down in South
America,” Jed went on, looking inquiringly
at Sam.</p>

<p>“Heh, heh! thet was another time,”
said Sam, with his dry little laugh.
“Good nation! ef all the luck thet’s
threatened to hit him hed <em>done</em> it, he’d be
the richest man in this caounty. I tell ye,
good luck’s allers a-sniffin’ at his heels,
but he don’t never git bit. This time he
got a letter f’om his cousin, tellin’ him
he’d allers felt sorry he hed sech poor luck,
an’ he’d made him sole heir of his estate,
prob’ly wuth a couple o’ thousand dollars.
He hed some oncurable disease, he wrote,
an’ the doctors didn’t give him over three
months to live&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span></p>

<p>“S’pose he lived forever,” put in Jed,
chuckling.</p>

<p>“No, sir; he died in good shape, an’ in
fac’ he bettered his word, for he didn’t
live two months f’om the time he wrote to
Seth; but I’m blessed ef they didn’t find
there was some claim against the estate
thet et it all up. Well, sir, I never saw
any one laugh so hard ez Seth when he
heard the news. It struck him ez a dretful
good joke.”</p>

<p>“He must hev a purty paowerful sense
of the ridikerlus,” said Jed, dryly.</p>

<p>“Well, he hez,” assented Sam, rubbing
his knees with his horny hands. “Ain’t
no better comp’ny ’an Seth. Ain’t never
daownhearted.”</p>

<p>After a moment’s silence Silas smiled,
and, closing his eyes, pinched them between
thumb and forefinger as if calling
up some pleasing recollection. At last he
said: “Ye know, Seth allers works by the
day. He gin’ally has enough to do to
keep him busy, an’ allers doos his work up
slick, but he never hed stiddy employment,
on’y once, an’ then it lasted on’y<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
one day. ’Member that, Sam? Time he
went to work at the Nutmeg State clock-shop?”</p>

<p>“<em>Yes</em>, yes,” laughed Sam, driving a
loose nail into the platform with his heel.</p>

<p>“Stiddy employment fer a day, eh?”
said Jed, grinning. “Thet’s ’baout ez
stiddy ez my hired man, an’ he ain’t stiddy
at all.”</p>

<p>“It was this way,” Silas went on.
“Seth allers was purty slick at han’lin’
tools, an’ Zenas Jordan was foreman of the
shop, an’ he offered Seth a place there at
twelve dollars a week, which was purty
good pay an’ more ’n Seth could make
outside, ’thout it was hayin’-time. I met
him on his way to work fust mornin’.
‘Well, luck’s with you this time, Seth,’
says I. ‘Sh!’ says he. ‘Don’t say thet,
or I’ll lose my job sure. It’s jes better ’n
nothin’, thet’s all. <em>Don’t</em> call it good
luck’; an’ he laafed an’ went along
a-whistlin’. B’ Gosht! ef the blamed ol’
shop didn’t burn daown thet very night,
an’, ez ye know, they never rebuilt. Seth
he come to me nex’ day, an’ he says,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
kinder reproachful: ‘You’d orter held yer
tongue, Silas. I’d be’n hopin’ thet was a
stroke er luck thet hed hit me by mistake,
an’ I wasn’t goin’ to whisper its name for
fear it’d reckernize me an’ leave me, and
you hed to go an’ yell it aout when ye met
me.’” And Silas laughed heartily at recollection
of the whimsicality.</p>

<p>“Cur’us, ain’t it, what a grudge luck
doos hev against some men?” remarked
Jed, rubbing his smooth chin meditatively.</p>

<p>Far down the valley I heard the faint
whistle of a locomotive.</p>

<p>“Las’ story they tell ’baout Seth ’s
this,” Silas said, rising and stretching himself,
and then leaning against the wall of
the station. “He’s a very good judge o’
poultry, an’, in fac’, he gin’ally judges at
the caounty fair every fall. Well, a man
daown in Ansony told him he’d pay him
ten dollars apiece for a couple of fine
thoroughbred Plymouth Rock roosters.
Seth knowed a man daown Smithfield
way named Jones thet owned some full-blooded
stock, but ez he on’y kep’ ’em fer
home use he didn’t set a fancy price on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
’em, an’ Seth knowed he could git ’em fer
seventy-five cents or a dollar apiece.
Well, it happened a day or two later he
was engaged to do a day’s work fer this
man Jones, an’ he went daown there. He
see two all-fired fine roosters a-struttin’
raound the place, an’ he cal’lated to buy
them; but fer some reason he didn’t say
nothin’ ’baout it jes then to Jones, but
went to work at choppin’ or sawin’ or
whatever it was he was doin’.”</p>

<p>“Said nothin’, did he? <em>Must</em> ha’
sawed wood, then,” interrupted Jed, looking
over at me and winking.</p>

<p>“Sure! Well, when it kem time fer dinner
he hed got up a good appetite, an’ he
was glad to set daown to table, fer Jones
is a purty good feeder an’ likes to see
people hev enough. Hed stewed chicken
fer dinner, an’ Seth says he never enjoyed
any so much in his life. After dinner he
says, ‘By the way, Jones, what’ll ye take
fer those two Plymouth Rock roosters ’t
I saw this mornin’?’ Jones bust aout
a-laafin’, an’ he says, ‘Ye kin take what’s
left on ’em home in a basket an’ welcome!’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
Blamed ef Seth hedn’t be’n eatin’ a dinner
that cost him nigh on to twenty dollars.”</p>

<p>“Thet <em>must</em> hev riled him some,” remarked
Jed.</p>

<p>“No, sir; he never seemed to realize
the sitooation.”</p>

CUPID ON RUNNERS</h4>
</div>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_dcl.jpg"  alt="L" /></div>

<p class="drop-cap">Littlewood Phillips had
been in love with Mildred Farrington
for two years, ever since
he first met her at the Hollowells’ card-party.
He had no good reason to doubt
that his love was returned, yet so fearful
was he that he had misread her feelings that
he had never hinted that she was more to
him than any of the girls he met at the
church sociables and card-parties in Newington.</p>

<p>So matters stood when a snowfall that
brought sleighing in its wake visited Newington,
and Littlewood became conscious
of the fact that he had actually asked Miss
Farrington to take a ride with him. Of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
course he must perforce bring matters to
a crisis now.</p>

<p>The evening was soon at hand. A
crescent moon shone in the west, and the
stars were cold and scintillating. He
walked to the livery-stable and asked for
the cutter, and a few moments later he
was driving a handsome chestnut to the
house where his thought spent most of the
time.</p>

<p>Miss Farrington kept him waiting a
good half-hour, but he reflected that it was
the privilege of her glorious sex, and it
only made him love her the more. If she
had come out and placed her dainty foot
upon his neck he would have been overcome
with rapture.</p>

<p>It was cold waiting, so he got out and
hitched his horse and paced in front of her
house, her faithful sentinel until death&mdash;if
need be. Not that there was any reason
to think that his services would be required,
but it pleased his self-love to imagine
himself dying for this lovely being of
whom his tongue stood in such awe that it
could scarce loose itself in her presence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span></p>

<p>At last she appears. The restive horse
slants his ears at her and paws the ground
in admiration of her beauty, for Mildred
was as pretty as regular features, a fair
skin, and melting eyes could make her.</p>

<p>Littlewood handed her into the sleigh,
stepped in himself, tucked in the robes,
and chirruped to the horse.</p>

<p>That intelligent animal did not move.
A flush of mortification overspread the
face of the would-be amorous swain. A
balky horse, and at the start! What
chance would he have to deliver his precious
message that was to make two hearts
happy? He clicked again to the horse,
but again the horse continued to stand
still.</p>

<p>“You might unhitch him, Mr. Phillips.
That would help,” said Mildred, in her
sweet voice.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes&mdash;t-to be sure! I must have
tied him. I mean I&mdash;er&mdash;I di&mdash;I think I
did hitch&mdash;er&mdash;”</p>

<p>“There seems to have been a hitch
somewhere,” she answered.</p>

<p>He stepped out of the sleigh and looked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
over his shoulder at her in a startled way.
Could she mean anything? Was this
encouragement? Oh, no! It was too
soon. (Too soon, and he had been in love
two years!) He unhitched the horse and
once more placed himself beside his loved
one.</p>

<p>The frosty night seemed to have set a
seal upon her lips, for as they sped over
the crunching snow and left the town behind
them she was silent.</p>

<p>“I must have offended her. I’ve probably
made a break of some kind,” said
Littlewood to himself. “How unfortunate!
But I must tell her to-night. It is
now or never. She knows I never took
anybody but my mother sleigh-riding
before.”</p>

<p>Then began a process of nerving himself
to the avowal. He ground his knees together
until the bones ached. His breathing was feverish.</p>

<p>Finally he made bold to say: “Mildewed.”
And then he stopped. He had
never called her Mildred before. He had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
never called her Mildewed either, but that
was accidental, and he hoped that she had
not noticed
the slip.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp53" id="i177" style="max-width: 25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_177.jpg"  alt="" />
</div>

<p>“I have
something
of the
greatest
importance
to say to you.”</p>

<p>Did he imagine
it, or did
she nestle closer to him? He must have
been mistaken, and to show that he was
quite sure he edged away from her as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
much as the somewhat narrow confines of
the sleigh would allow.</p>

<p>“What do you wish to say, Mr.
Phillips?”</p>

<p>“Mr.” Phillips! Ah, then she was
offended. To be sure, she had always
called him that, but after his last remark
it must have an added significance.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;er&mdash;do you like sleigh-riding?”</p>

<p>“Why, of course, or else I shouldn’t
have come.”</p>

<p>Did she mean that as a slap at him?
Was it only for the ride, and not for his
company, that she had come? Oh, he
could never make an avowal of love after
that! He knew his place. This beautiful
girl was not for a faint-hearted caitiff like
himself.</p>

<p>“Nun&mdash;nun&mdash;no, to be sure not. I&mdash;er&mdash;thought
that was why you came.”</p>

<p>Mildred turned her gazelle-like eyes
upon him. “I’m afraid I don’t understand
you.”</p>

<p>That settled it. If she didn’t understand
him when he talked of nothing in
particular, he must be very blind in his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
utterance, and he could never trust his
tongue to carry such a heavy freight as a
declaration of love. No, there was nothing
to do but postpone it.</p>

<p>Mildred drank in the beauty of the
scenes, and wished that it were decorous
for women to propose.</p>

<p>Under the influence of sweet surroundings,
Mildred at last said pointedly: “Is
it so that more people get engaged in
winter than in summer?”</p>

<p>She blushed as she spoke. It was unmaidenly,
but he was such a dear gump.
Now he would declare himself. But she
did not know the capabilities for self-repression
of her two-year admirer.</p>

<p>He said to himself: “What a slip!
What a delightful slip! If I were unprincipled
I would take advantage of it
and propose, but I would bitterly reproach
myself forever, whatever her answer was.”</p>

<p>So he said in as matter-of-fact tone as
he could master when his heart was beating
his ribs like a frightened cageling: “I
really can’t answer offhand, but I’ll look
it up for you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span></p>

<p>“Do. Write a letter to the newspaper.”</p>

<p>Her tones were as musical as ever, but
Littlewood thought he detected a sarcastic
ring in them, and he thanked his stars
that he had not yielded to his natural desire
to propose at such an inauspicious
time.</p>

<p>“What was that important thing you
wanted to say?” asked Miss Farrington,
after several minutes of silence, save for
the hoofs and the runners and the bells.</p>

<p>“Oh, it wasn’t of any importance! I
mean it will keep. I&mdash;er&mdash;I was thinking
of something else.”</p>

<p>“I think you have gone far enough,”
said she, innocently, looking over her
shoulder in the direction of home. Maybe
the return would loosen his obdurate
tongue.</p>

<p>His heart stopped beating and lay a
leaden thing in his breast. Had he, then,
gone too far? What had he said? Oh,
why had he come out with this lovely being,
the mere sight of whom was enough
to make one cast all restraint to the winds<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
and declare in thunderous tones that he
loved her?</p>

<p>“I think that we’d better go back,” he
said, and turned so quickly that he nearly
upset the sleigh. “Your mother will be
anxious.”</p>

<p>“Yes; when one is accountable to one’s
mother one has to remember time. I
suppose it is different when one is accountable
to a&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Father?” said Littlewood, asininely.</p>

<p>“No; that wasn’t the word I wanted.”</p>

<p>“A-a-aunt?”</p>

<p>Could Mildred love him if he gave many
more such proofs of being an abject idiot?</p>

<p>“No; husband is what I want.”</p>

<p>Littlewood’s brain swam. He had been
tempted once too often. This naïve girl
had innocently played into his hands, and
now the Rubicon must be crossed, even if
its angry waters engulfed him.</p>

<p>“Pardon me, Miss&mdash;er&mdash;Mildred,”&mdash;he
did not say Mildewed this time,&mdash;“if I
twist your words into another meaning,
but if you&mdash;er&mdash;want a husband&mdash;do you
think I would do?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span></p>

<p>A head nestled on his shoulder, a little
hand was in his, and when he passed the
Farrington mansion neither he nor she
knew it.</p>

MY TRUTHFUL BURGLAR</h4>
</div>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_dci.jpg"  alt="I" /></div>

<p class="drop-cap">I had an experience with a burglar
night before last. My family
are all away, and I have been living
alone in the house, a detached villa in
New Jersey, for upward of a month. Several
burglaries have occurred in the vicinity.</p>

<p>Night before last I was awakened about
four o’clock by a noise made by a clicking
door, and opening my eyes, I saw a
smooth-faced, determined-looking man at
my bedside. I did not cry out, nor hide
under the bedclothes, nor do any of the
conventional things that one does when a
burglar comes to him.</p>

<p>I looked at him calmly for a moment,
and then I said, “How d’ do?”</p>

<p>An expression of surprise passed over<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
his intelligent features, but he said mechanically,
“Pretty well, thank you. And
you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m as well as could be expected
under the circumstances. Are you the
burglar who has been doing this village?”</p>

<p>“I am,” said he, drawing up a chair
and sitting down.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you deny it?” I asked. I
wasn’t afraid. He amused me, this nonchalant
burglar.</p>

<p>“Well, because I’m not ashamed of
my profession, for one reason, and mainly
because I was brought up by my father to
tell the truth.”</p>

<p>“You tell the truth, and yet you are a
burglar. How can you reconcile those
facts?”</p>

<p>“They are not irreconcilable,” said he,
taking a corn-cob pipe out of his pocket
and filling it. “I am a burglar, and my
father was one before me, but he was a
perfectly honorable man. He never lied,
and I never lie. I steal because that is
my profession, but I make it a rule to tell
the truth upon all occasions. Why, if the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
success of my venture to-night depended
upon my lying to you, I’d immediately
leave this place, as innocent of plunder as
when I came in. Where’s the silver?”</p>

<p>“Top drawer of the sideboard.” There
was a magnetism, a bonhomie, about the
man that captivated me.</p>

<p>“Are you armed?” asked he, as he
puffed at his pipe.</p>

<p>“If I had been I’d have winged you
before this,” said I, laughing.</p>

<p>“I believe you, and I honor you for being
perfectly frank with me.”</p>

<p>“Why, as to that, I’m not to be outdone
in frankness by a thief.”</p>

<p>“That will make my task so much the
easier. After I’ve finished this pipe I
want you to give me your word that
you’ll lie still until I’ve taken all I want.”</p>

<p>I admired the man’s nerve, and I said:
“For the time being I consider you my
guest, and, Spanish fashion, my house is
at your disposal.”</p>

<p>“Don’t put it on that basis, or I will
leave at once. This is no time for aping
the Spanish.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span></p>

<p>“You are right. But I tell you candidly
that I would far rather have found
out that you were a liar than a burglar.
Your lies would not be likely to injure me,
but I’ll be out just so much by what you
take. I’d much rather you were a liar.”</p>

<p>“And I would not. If I steal, I do
but take something that, to paraphrase
Shakspere, was yours, is mine, and has
been slave to thousands; but to lie would
be to ‘lay perjury to my soul,’ and that I
would not do, ‘no, not for Venice’!”</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i186" style="max-width: 31.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_186.jpg"  alt="" />
</div>

<p>“I see you know Shakspere,” said I,
punching my pillow so that I could be
more comfortable. I was reading this odd
fellow, and I believed that I could dissuade
him from his purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span></p>

<p>“Know Shakspere? I was an actor
once.”</p>

<p>I felt that I had him, for I know actors
better than he knew Shakspere.</p>

<p>“Did you ever play Hamlet?” I asked,
sitting up in bed.</p>

<p>“I did; and I made such a hit that if it
hadn’t been for the venality of the press
and my sense of honor, I would have been
adjudged one of the greatest Hamlets of
the day.”</p>

<p>“Give me the soliloquy. I give you
my word that ordinarily I’d rather be
robbed than hear it, but I like your voice
and I believe that you can do it justice.”</p>

<p>A self-satisfied smile illuminated his
face. He laid down the pipe and gave me
the soliloquy, and it wasn’t bad.</p>

<p>“Bully!” I said, when he had finished.
“Why, man, you make an indifferent thief,
else you would have decamped long ago;
but the stage has lost an actor that would
have in time compelled the unwilling
admiration of the press.”</p>

<p>And so I jollied him, and he gave me
the trial scene from “The Merchant of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
Venice,” and other selections, until dawn
began to show in the east, when he picked
up his bag and said, “It would be a shame
to rob a white man like you.” Then he
bade me good-by and left.</p>

<p>And I congratulated myself upon my
knowledge of human nature, until I began
to dress, when I found that the fellow had
finished his burgling before I woke, and
he has all my silver.</p>

THE MAN WITHOUT A WATCH</h4>
</div>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_dct.jpg"  alt="T" /></div>

<p class="drop-cap">Thomas Morley knew the
value of promptitude. He was a
young man on whom ninety-two
seasons had poured benefits and adversities,
although many of the latter he took to be
the former, his temperament shedding
sorrow as a duck does water, to use a
castanean simile.</p>

<p>He was a born and bred New-Yorker,
but at the time of which we write he had
been living for the last ten or twelve
months in Uxton, up among the hills of
northwestern Connecticut, studying the
natives; for he was a writer.</p>

<p>Having filled a portfolio with material
for enough dialect stories to run one of
the great magazines for a year, he deter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>mined
to seek his matter in the metropolis,
and to that end applied for a reportership
on the New York “Courier-Journal,” in
which paper many of his brightest things
had appeared at remunerative rates.</p>

<p>As has been said, he knew the value of
promptitude, so when, at eight o’clock one
night, Farmer Phelps’s hired man handed
him a letter from James Fitzgerald, managing
editor of the “Courier-Journal,” asking
him to come and see him in regard to
a reportership as soon as possible, he
made up his mind to take the train which
left Winsonia, four miles distant, at six
o’clock next morning. This would enable
him to reach the office by half-past ten,
and probably catch Mr. Fitzgerald on his
arrival at his desk.</p>

<p>Next morning he arose at four, and
when he left the house he had sixty minutes
in which to walk four miles downhill&mdash;ample
time, surely.</p>

<p>It was so ample that he would have had
fifteen minutes to spare if the home clock
had been right. As it was, he arrived at
the station in time to see the train rapidly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
disappearing around a curve, on its way
to New York. He laughed good-naturedly
with the baggageman, and asked
him when the next down train was due.</p>

<p>“Seven-thirty, sharp. You’ll not have
to wait long.”</p>

<p>Seven-thirty. That would bring him
into the presence of Mr. Fitzgerald at just
about the time he arrived at his sanctum.
“Better than to have to wait in a presumably
stuffy room,” said he to himself,
philosophically. He lit a cigar, and, as
the air was bracing and he was fond of
walking, he struck out into a five-mile-an-hour
gait down the main street of Winsonia.</p>

<p>His footsteps led him farther than he
had intended going, and when he reached
the Baptist church at East Winsonia, he
saw by its clock that it lacked but forty
minutes of train-time, and he had four
miles to make. He threw away the
stump of his cigar, which had been out for
some time, broke into a jog-trot, and, after
covering a mile, he caught his second wind
and mended his pace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span></p>

<p>His fleetness would have served its turn
had not a malicious breeze blown his hat
over a high iron fence that surrounded a
churchyard. By the time he had climbed
the fence and recovered his hat he had
consumed so many precious minutes that,
although he sprinted the last mile, he arrived
at the station only in time to see
train No. 2 disappearing around that hateful
curve.</p>

<p>The baggageman was standing on the
platform, and he said:</p>

<p>“Ain’t once enough?”</p>

<p>“More than enough for most people,”
said Thomas, whose rare good nature was
proof against even such a remark at such
a time.</p>

<p>The next train for New York was
due at nine fifty-six. Being somewhat
blown, he walked around the corner to
a billiard-room, meaning to sit down
and watch whatever game might be in
progress.</p>

<p>“It may be,” soliloquized Thomas,
“that Fitzgerald won’t reach the office
until after lunch, and I’ll get there at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
half-past two, in time to see him when he’s
feeling good.”</p>

<p>He met Ned Halloway at the billiard-room,
and when Ned asked him to take a
cue he consented. Billiards was a game
in which he was apt to lose&mdash;himself, at
any rate; yet to-day his mind was enough
on the alert to enable him, after a time, to
glance at the clock over the bar in the next
room. It was forty-five minutes past
eight.</p>

<p>They began another game. Later he
looked again at the clock. A quarter of
nine. After another game he looked up
once more. “Fifteen minutes to ni&mdash;.
Say, Ned, what’s the matter with that
clock?” Ned looked at it, then at his
watch. “Why, it’s stopped!”</p>

<p>“You settle&mdash;see you later.” And
Thomas was gone like a shot.</p>

<p>This time he had the rare pleasure of
noting how the rear car of a train grows
rapidly smaller as it recedes. In a moment
the train disappeared around the
curve before mentioned.</p>

<p>“Say, Mr. Morley, you’ve time to miss<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
the next, easy,” said the baggageman,
dryly.</p>

<p>Thomas was vexed, but he said pleasantly:
“When is it due?”</p>

<p>“Half-past two. Better wait here and
make sure of it.”</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp57" id="i194" style="max-width: 18.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_194.jpg"  alt="" />
</div>

<p>“Oh, dry up! No; do the other thing;
it’s on me.”</p>

<p>After this little duty had been performed,
Thomas, with an irrelevancy of action
that might have struck an observer as
amusing, made his way to the Y.M.C.A.
rooms to read the magazines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span></p>

<p>“Let’s see,” said he; “I’ll get to his
desk at seven. He’ll be hard at work,
and, if he engages me, he may send me
out on an assignment at once. Glad I
missed the other trains.”</p>

<p>Thus was Thomas wont to soliloquize.
At one o’clock he went to Conley’s Inn,
and sat down to one of those dinners that
attract drummers to a hotel. Necessarily,
then, it was a good dinner, and one over
which he lingered until nearly two. Then
he went into the office and sat down.</p>

<p>The room was warm, and his dinner
had made him drowsy. He decided to
take a little nap. He had the faculty of
waking when he pleased, and he willed
to do so at fifteen minutes past two. It
would be weakness for him to get to the
station with too much time to spare, but
this would give him a quarter-hour in
which to go a half-mile.</p>

<p>His awakening faculty would seem to
have been slightly out of order that day,
however, and he did not arouse until
twenty-nine minutes past two by the hotel
clock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span></p>

<p>Of course he did not make a fool of
himself by trying to do a half-mile in sixty
seconds; but he walked leisurely toward
the station, intending to get his ticket and
have that off his mind.</p>

<p>He laughed heartily at a corpulent fellow
who darted by him, carrying a grip.</p>

<p>His laughter ceased, however, when, on
turning the corner, he discerned the aforesaid
fat man in the act of being assisted
on to the platform of the last car by the
brakeman, the train having acquired considerable
momentum. Then he saw it
disappear around a curve which was part
of the road at that point. There were
three explanations possible: either the
train was behind time, or else his awakening
faculty was in good repair, or the
hotel clock was fourteen minutes fast.
The latter proved to be the correct explanation
of the somewhat vexing occurrence.</p>

<p>“Say, that’s a bad habit you have of
missing trains,” said his friend the baggageman.
“Goin’ to miss another&mdash;or do
anything else?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span></p>

<p>“No,” said Thomas, shortly.</p>

<p>He knew that the next train at five
was the last. This would make it possible
to reach Fitzgerald at half-past nine.
“Right in the heat of the work. He’ll
engage me to get rid of me,” laughed
Thomas to himself. Then he continued:
“I never heard of a man missing every
train in a day, so I’ll risk calling on Laura
before the next one starts.”</p>

<p>Miss Sedgwick, the one he called Laura,
lived out of town near the railroad track,
and two miles nearer New York than
Winsonia station.</p>

<p>She was a captivating girl, and when
Thomas was in her presence he never took
heed of time. He was lucky enough to
find her at home. She seemed glad to see
him, and was much interested in his account
of how near he had come to catching
some trains that day; and as nothing is
so engaging as a good listener, the minutes
passed on pneumatic tires. When at
last he took note of the hour, it was five
o’clock.</p>

<p>“That clock isn’t right, is it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, sir. Father keeps it at railroad
time. Mercy! you’ve lost your train
again, haven’t you?”</p>

<p>“Laura, this time it’s bad. I won’t see
him to-day, now, and to-morrow may not
do. Let me go and kick myself.”</p>

<p>“I’m awfully sorry, Tom. I hope to-morrow
won’t be too late.”</p>

<p>Thomas squeezed her hand and left her,
feeling rather blue.</p>

<p>The railroad track was but a block away,
and he walked over to it, not with suicidal
intent, but just that he might tantalize
himself with a view of the train as it sped
by, which it should do in about a minute.</p>

<p>“At any rate,” said he, “it won’t be
going around that dreadful curve.”</p>

<p>It was the last of December, and the
sun had set. When he reached the track
he saw, far away, a glimmer of the headlight
of the five-o’clock express.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer it came. A moment
more and it would rush by like a meteor.
But it didn’t. It slackened up at the very
corner on which Thomas stood, to allow
an official of the road to jump off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span></p>

<p>Thomas was not slow, if he did miss
trains now and then. He swung himself
on to the smoker.</p>

<p>“Go’n’ far?” asked the brakeman.</p>

<p>“To New York,” was his reply.</p>

<p>“You’re in luck.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve not missed more than three
or four trains in my life!” said Thomas;
and it was strictly true.</p>

<p>Half-past nine to the minute found him
outside of the editorial rooms of the
“Courier-Journal.”</p>

<p>“Can I see Mr. Fitzgerald?” he asked
of a boy who came in response to a knock.</p>

<p>“No, sir; he went out of town yesterday.
Be back to-morrow at twelve.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“Did you get my letter already?”
asked Mr. Fitzgerald of Thomas Morley,
when he came to his desk next morning
and found that young man waiting for
him.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; and here I am.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, I like your promptness, and
I’ll give you the place of a man whom we
had to discharge for being too slow. You<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
seem to have what a reporter needs most
of all&mdash;the ‘get there’ quality.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t allow any trains to pass me,”
said Thomas, modestly.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">If there be those who love not the
sea, with its storms, its seaweed,
its sharks and shrimps and ships,
this is not the story for them, and they
would best weigh anchor and steer for
some tale written by a landlubber and full
of green meadows and trees and such
tommy-rot, for this is to be chock-a-block
with nautical phrases.</p>

<p>And who am I, you ask? I am Joseph<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
Inland, the tenth of that name. We have
always lived and died here in Birmingham,
and followed the trade of cutlers; but
when I was a babe of one year father
told mother ’twas time one member of
the family followed the sea, wherever it
went, and that he intended to make a sailor
of me.</p>

<p>So before I was six I had heard of
sloops and ferry-boats and belaying-pins
and admirals and salt-junk, and longed to
hear the wind whistling through the maintopgallantmast,
and could say “boat-swain”
as glibly as any sailor afloat. But
father was in moderate circumstances;
and so, much as he would have liked to,
he could not afford to send me to sea
when I was a boy, and that is why my
one-and-twentieth birthday came and went
and I had never been farther from Birmingham
than my legs could carry me in a
day; but you may be sure that I subscribed
to the “Seaman’s Daily,” and through
a friend who knew a sailor I had picked
up such terms as “amidships,” “deck,”
“boom,” “bilge-water,” “forecastle,” and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
the like, so that I was a seaman in everything
save actual experience.</p>

<p>And in the amateur dramatic society of
which I was a member I always played
sailors’ parts, and did them so well
that when we played “Hamlet” they
changed the part of the grave-digger to
that of a sailor for me, and I made a great
hit in it. The one who played Hamlet
didn’t like the change, as it interfered
with his lines and his business with a skull,
and he refused to come on at all in that
act; but I sang a sea-song instead, and
the newspaper came out and said that
my singing was no worse than his acting
would have been, which I thought pretty
neat.</p>

<p>But enough of that. I was always fond
of joking, and had nigh unto a score of
comical sayings that I used to repeat to
my friends when they would come to our
house of an evening; but they didn’t
often come. My father said I was as
comical a lad as he ever knew, and would
slap me on the back and roar that it was
the funniest thing he had heard in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
twelvemonth when I made one particular
joke, the tenor of which I forget now.
But all the jokes dealt with the sea.</p>

<p>Well, so much for my life up to my one-and-twentieth
birthday. You have learned
that if ever a body was fitted for a sea life,
that body was mine.</p>

<p>By the time I was six-and-twenty I
don’t believe there was a sea term that
I did not have at my tongue’s end, and I
always wore my trousers wide at the lower
end, and kept a chew of tobacco in my
mouth day and night, although after a
time I failed to notice any taste in it.</p>

<p>It was a gladsome sight to see me go
rolling to my work in the cutler’s shop
(for I still followed the old trade), with a
hearty “Ho, landsman! good mornin’ to
ye!” to all I met, in true sailor fashion.</p>

<p>Our fare at home consisted of loblolly,
ship’s-biscuit, salt-junk, and plum-duff,
with water drawn from casks. My dear
old mother used sometimes to wish for
home-made bread and fresh meat and
vegetables and pump water; and I remember,
one winter, brother died of the scurvy;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
but I was better content than if he had
died of some landsman’s complaint, and
mother was glad to put up with anything,
she was so proud that I was to be a seaman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter illowp48" id="i205" style="max-width: 25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_205.jpg"  alt="" />
</div>

<p>I had a carpenter construct my parents’
bedroom so that the whole floor could be
rocked; and on stormy nights I would stay
up and by a simple mechanism keep it
a-rocking until poor old mother would be
as sick as if she were in the Channel. But
I never heard her murmur. <em>She</em> was fit
for a sailor’s wife.</p>

<p>On such nights father never went to bed,
but stayed down-stairs. There was little
of the seaman’s spirit in the old man.</p>

<p>When I was one-and-thirty I had a rare
chance to ship before the mast on a whaler
sailing from Liverpool; but as business
was pretty brisk at the shop, I decided to
wait, and the offer was not renewed when
she returned, three years later.</p>

<p>When I was forty dear mother entered
her last port. The doctor, a blundering
landlubber, fond of landsmen’s phrases, said
she died of insufficient nutriment. Be
that as it may or what it may, in her I
lost one whose heart was always on my
going to sea. Douse my top-lights if ever
there was a craft that carried a stancher
heart from barnacle to binnacle than did<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
the old lady, and I had her buried in
shrouds, with a cannon-ball at the foot of
the coffin, as befitted the mother of one
who was going to be a seaman.</p>

<p>After she died I became even more impatient
to be off to sea, for there’s no air
so pure as the sea air, no hearts so true as
seamen’s hearts, no weed like seaweed,
and no water that’s fit to drink save sea
water; but business was pretty good, so,
for the present, I decided to stay ashore;
but I always read the shipping news with
as much keenness as any sailor afloat.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And now I’ve come to the end of my
yarn. I named it “The Wreck of the
‘Catapult’” because it had a salty savor.
It was the name of one of my favorite
Sunday-school books when I was a lad.
Now I am an old man, threescore and
ten, and have been alone in the world a
score of years. Heaven denied me the
blessing of children, but I have a grandson
who is as hot for the sea as I was.</p>

<p>Ah, me! Next week I am going to
apply for admission to the Sailors’ Home;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
for although circumstances have prevented
my ever seeing the ocean or scenting its
salty breezes, I have always been, and always
shall be, at heart a British seaman.</p>

<p>Shiver my timbers!</p>

THE BULL, THE GIRL, AND THE RED SHAWL</h4>
</div>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_dct.jpg"  alt="T" /></div>

<p class="drop-cap">There is no incident in all the
realms of literature, from the
“penny dreadful” up to the
three-volume novel, that has afforded so
much material for the pen of the writer of
fiction as the delightful episode of the
bull, the young girl with the red shawl,
and the young girl’s lover. Sometimes
the cast includes the lover’s hated rival,
but the story may be told without using
him.</p>

<p>It is thirty-odd years since I first came
across this thrilling adventure in the pages
of a child’s book, very popular at the time.
How well I remember how my young
blood&mdash;to be exact, my seven-year-old<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
blood&mdash;thrilled as I mentally watched this
frail girl, with a start of just three feet,
lead the tremendous and horribly savage
bull in a three-hundred-yard sprint, only to
trip at last on the only obstruction in the
ten-acre field; how, just as the bull reached
her, she flung her red shawl a few rods
to the right; how the bull, leaving her,
plunged after it; how she, weak and
trembling, ran to the stone wall and managed
to vault it just as her lover, a brawny
blacksmith, who had seen the whole affair
at too great a distance to be of immediate
service, reached the wall and received her
in his arms. “Oh, Kenston,” she murmured,
“you have saved my life!” And
then she fainted, and I believe the bull
ate up the shawl; at any rate, its part in
that particular story was ended.</p>

<p>I have always felt that, thrilling as this
scene was, it had not been worked for all
it was worth; but an extensive reading
since then has brought me to the conclusion
that, first and last, it has been worked
for its full value.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span></p>

<p>The next time that I read the enthralling
narrative I was some years older, but the
memory of the other telling was still fresh
within me; and so, when, in the second
chapter, I read about a savage old bull,
one Hector, the property of Squire Flint,
the meanest man in the county,&mdash;not that
his meanness had anything to do with the
story, but it is one of the conventions that
a savage bull shall be owned by a cross,
crabbed, and thoroughly stingy man,&mdash;I
say, when I had read thus far my pulse
quickened. Inexperienced as I was, I
somehow sensed the coming situation. I
seemed to know as by clairvoyance that,
however limited the heroine’s wardrobe
might be in some respects, there was one
article of apparel that she surely possessed,
or would possess in time to meet the exigencies.
True enough, in the very next
chapter her maiden aunt, a saintly old
lady of ninety, died and bequeathed to her
sorrowing niece a red pongee shawl of
great value&mdash;as a bull-enrager. The book
had seemed prosy at the start, but now that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
I knew what was coming, and that it was
<em>that</em> that was coming, I read on breathlessly.</p>

<div class="figleft illowe15_625" id="i214">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_214.jpg"  alt="" />
</div>

<p>Needless to say that in the next chapter
the young girl fell in love with a strapping
young fellow, who immediately proposed
that they take a walk.
How well I knew,
though they did not,
where that walk
would lead them!
The mad bull&mdash;in
this case it was
mad, although
any old bull will
do, mad or not&mdash;was
rampant in a
lot a mile south
of the young girl’s
house, and they started to walk due north;
but I knew full well that they would need
to cross that particular pasture before they
got home, and a few pages later found
them climbing over a stone wall into the
bull’s domain, and then they walked along,
intent only on their new-found happiness.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
The day was chilly,&mdash;in the middle of a
particularly hot July,&mdash;so that the girl could
have an excuse to wear her red shawl.
Now, having brought two of the actors
upon the stage, the cue was soon given to
the bull; and in a moment the happy
lovers, feeling the ground tremble beneath
their feet, turned and saw Hector, his horns
gyrating with rage, his eyes bulging out,
and his head lowered as he thundered
along straight for the pongee bequest.
To take her under his strong arm and to
rush forward were the only things for the
young man to do, and he did them; and
then the rest ran as per schedule. I believe
that in this case the young man threw
the girl into a tree and then plunged down
a woodchuck’s hole. At any rate, the girl
was unharmed. That is the one unalterable
formula in constructing these bull stories:
save the girl unharmed. You may break
the young man’s leg or arm, and you may
do what you will with the bull, but the
young girl must come through unscathed.</p>

<p>It was years before this moving incident
ceased to hold me, and in that time<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
how many changes were rung on it! Once
only was the red shawl absent, and I wondered
how in the world the bull was to be
infuriated, as he was a singularly mild
beast in the earlier chapters, and on Maydays
had been festooned with garlands.
Then, too, the girl was in deep mourning&mdash;for
her lover! But the ten-acre lot was
all right, and as the author was a clever
man, I felt that he would find a way to
run the act with a small cast and no properties.
So I read on, and after wondering,
together with the girl herself, what could
have caused the peaceful old bovine to
chase her, tail up and head down, the full
length of a particularly long pasture, she
and I found out when she realized that,
the day being sunny, she had picked up
her cousin’s parasol, which was necessarily
of a brilliant scarlet. She had no lover,
for, as I say, he had died&mdash;two chapters
before the book was begun; but she did
have presence of mind, and so she inserted
the point of the parasol in the bull’s
mouth, and then opened it, and while he
was extracting it with his fore paws, she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
reached the fence and vaulted it in the
usual way.</p>

<p>The possibilities of the incident are by
no means exhausted, and so far from
“Amos Judd” being the last story in
which it was used, I saw it in a tale published
this month, and this time with the
full paraphernalia of hated rival, lover, red
shawl, and all; but for me it had lost its
zest. To be sure, if they would make the
hero an athlete, and have him bravely
stand his ground while the girl climbed to
the top of an enormous elm, and then, just
as the bull lowered his head to toss him,
have the hero jump high in the air and
make the bull pass beneath him, and as
he reached ground again seize the bull,
not by the horns, but by the tail, and,
swinging it three times around his head,
dash it against a tree and stun it,&mdash;that is,
if its tail were securely welded to its body,&mdash;there
would be an original treatment of
the subject. And if its tail were but
loosely fixed to it, the hero could pull it
out, and the bull, filled with chagrin, would
walk off, dismayed and humiliated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span></p>

<p>But, pending that form of the story, I
am studiously avoiding all novels that contain
heroines with red shawls, or that make
early reference to fierce bulls, or that
speak of a certain ten-acre lot peculiarly
adapted for lovers’ peregrinations; for,
like the successful burglar, I know the
combination.</p>

CONCERNING DISH-WASHING</h4>
</div>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_dch.jpg"  alt="H" /></div>

<p class="drop-cap">Has the reader ever considered
how much time is wasted every
day by busy women in the work
of washing dishes? Of course, if a man
has plenty of money and, from philanthropic
motives, engages a girl to perform
this unpleasant&mdash;I had almost said “duty”&mdash;this
unpleasant task, I suppose we cannot,
strictly speaking, regard her time as
wasted, for she might else be loafing in an
intelligence-office without gaining a scrap
of that article. I refer to the lives led by
weary housewives who, having no aid from
a hired housemaid, day out and day in
will make themselves thin by the never-ceasing
and perfectly useless grind of dish-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>washing;
for the dishes don’t stay clean
for more than a few hours.</p>

<p>For years I ate my meals in selfish content,
little recking at what cost the clean
service was gained, until I discovered that
my sister, who is also my housekeeper,
had sold her piano, not having time to play
upon it. I was shocked to think what a
power this custom of dish-washing had
over the minds of the feminine portion of
our public.</p>

<p>But this dreadful waste of time that is
going on in thousands of homes in this
country every day was brought home to
me in a still more striking manner not
long after. My sister went away to visit
a friend, and left me to keep bachelor’s
hall. I had always had a good taste for
cooking, although hitherto my practice had
been confined to boiling eggs and buttering
hot toast on a plate at the back of the
stove. The first meal that I prepared, a
breakfast, consisted of oatmeal, steak, fried
potatoes, bread, butter, milk, and water.
We will pass over the meal itself, as its
discussion is foreign to our purpose. In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>deed,
the less said about it the better. It
was nine when I had finished eating, and
dumped my dishes and knives and forks
into tepid water. I am a fast worker, but
the clock in the neighboring church had
ceased striking twelve when my last dish
was wiped and put away.</p>

<p>I had hoped to do a little writing that
morning, but it was now time to get
luncheon. Luckily, that meal called into
play very few dishes, and by two, or half-past,
I had made an end of my second
stint. Feeling elated that I had a whole
afternoon on my hands, I prepared a
course dinner. I found some cold soup in
the refrigerator, and I bought a bluefish,
five or six pounds of beef for roasting,
some Parker House rolls, and a lemon-pie
for dessert. There were lettuce and eggs
in the house, and plenty of canned vegetables.
I also made some good coffee,
with the aid of a French coffee-pot, that
indispensable adjunct of a well-ordered
household. I found that the courses were
very hard to manage so that they would
follow in their proper order. They<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
weren’t even satisfied to finish together
like evenly matched racers, but the roast
was burned five minutes before I thought
of warming
up the soup,
and ten minutes
before I
had scaled the
fish. Then
the latter
wouldn’t
broil readily
until most of
it was in the
fire. The vegetables
I forgot
entirely, and I decided at the last moment
to deny myself the salad, as dinner was
waiting and I was hungry. I might add
that I inadvertently cut the pie with the
fish-knife, and that cast a damper on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
dessert. However, as I said, the coffee
was good&mdash;and, anyhow, I am digressing.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp51" id="i222" style="max-width: 18.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_222.jpg"  alt="" />
</div>

<p>It was seven when I emptied my dishes
into the water, and I worked with a will,
as I had a very exciting novel that I was
desirous of finishing. It was a few minutes
past eleven when I emptied my dish-pan
for the last time, and then I was ripe
for bed.</p>

<p>As time wore on I became more dexterous
in the use of the dish-cloth and
-towel, and the day before sister returned
I devoted but six hours to dish-washing.
To be sure, I had given up course dinners,
because they took too many plates, and for
other reasons that need not to be quoted
here.</p>

<p>As I say, I am a fast worker, and yet it
took me over six hours a day to clean the
crockery. Assuming that a woman can
do it in eight hours, she wastes half of her
waking moments in drudgery beside which
the making of bricks without straw would
be a pastime.</p>

<p>There is absolutely nothing in the dish-washing
habit to recommend it. It is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
ruinous to hands and temper, and, indeed,
I do not see but that it is immoral. Anything
that puts us in the proper mood for
swearing is immoral, and there is nothing
in the whole housekeeping routine so conducive
to highly spiced language as dish-washing.</p>

<p>And to what purpose is this waste of
time? I won’t go so far as to advocate a
return to the fingers that were used before
forks for the purpose of conveying food
to the mouth, for that would but relieve
us from the washing of cutlery; but I will
say that the man who will invent a cheap
yet very ornate dinner service that may
be destroyed after once using will have
earned the undying gratitude of the women
of this country and a princely fortune besides.</p>

<p>And when he has invented it, sister may
go on another visit.</p>

A PERENNIAL FEVER</h4>
</div>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_dct.jpg"  alt="T" /></div>

<p class="drop-cap">The world hears much of the
dangers of typhoid and yellow
and scarlet fever, and the skill of
physicians is ever employed to reduce
those dangers to a minimum; but in every
country, at all seasons of the year, there is
a fever that numbers its victims by the
thousand, and yet no doctor has ever prescribed
for it, nor is there any drug in the
pharmacopœia that will alleviate it.</p>

<p>The malady to which I refer is hen
fever.</p>

<p>If a city woman intends marrying a city
man, and then moving out a little way into
the country, as she values her peace of
mind, let her make sure that he is immune.
Unless, indeed, both are prepared to come<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
down with it at once. For it is unlike all
other fevers in that a man and his wife
may have it together and be happy; but if
he or she have it alone, then woe be to
that house.</p>

<p>The germs of hen fever are carried in a
chance conversation, in a picture of gallinaceous
activity, in the perusal of a poultry-book.
A man hears or looks or reads,
and the mischief is done. The subtle
poison is in his blood, although he knows
it not.</p>

<p>Hen fever takes various forms. With
some it is manifested in a desire to keep a
few blooded fowls and breed for points;
with another, to keep a few birds for the
sake of fresh eggs and broilers: but in
whatsoever form it come, it will cause the
upheaval of its victim’s most cherished
plans and habits.</p>

<p>He may have been an ardent admirer
of Shakspere, and in the evenings it has
been his wont to read aloud to his wife
while she knitted; but now, little recking
what she does, he reads to himself “Farm
Poultry” or “The Care of Hens,” or&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
this is the second stage of the disease&mdash;he
reads aloud to her that hens cannot thrive
without plenty of gravel, that cracked
wheat is better than whole corn for growing
pullets, that the best way to cure a hen of
eating her own eggs is to fill one with
mustard, etc.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp48" id="i227" style="max-width: 15.625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_227.jpg"  alt="" />
</div>

<p>Time was when he had an opinion on
politics, on finance, on literature, on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
thousand and one things that make for
conversation, and his neighbors dropped
in to hear him talk engagingly of what he
had read or seen; but now, when they
come, he tells them that his brown Leghorn
hen laid twenty eggs in twenty-five days,
while his buff Cochin laid only eight in the
same time; that his white Plymouth Rock
is crop-bound, and his Wyandotte rooster
has the pip.</p>

<p>Lucky indeed is his wife if he stick to
the good old way of hatching chickens by
hens instead of kerosene-oil; for if he
get an incubator she had better get a
divorce. How many homes have been
wrecked by patent incubators will never
be known.</p>

<p>But even if the fevered one stick to the
natural method of hatching, there will be
many times when his wife will wonder why
she left a comfortable and sociable home
to spend her evenings alone; for he will
be in the hen-house, setting hens, or washing
soiled eggs, or divesting nestlings of
the reluctant shell, or dusting his whole<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
flock with the snuff-like insecticide, or
kerosening their roosts.</p>

<p>With some the fever never abates; with
some it is intermittent; some have it hardest
in the spring of the year, when hens
are laying their prettiest, and profits may
be figured in money as well as on paper.
But whether it be light or heavy, hen fever
will run its course without let or hindrance;
and, as I have hinted, happy is the wife
who comes down with it simultaneously
with her husband; for, though their neighbors
will shun them as they would a
deadly pestilence, yet they will be company
for each other, and will prate ceaselessly,
yet cheerily, upon the best foods
for laying hens, the best exposure for
coops, how many hens can live in one
house with best results, when a chicken
should be weaned of bread, what breed
of hens is least idiotic, and kindred
topics.</p>

<p>As for me, I am free to come and go
among hens; to look on their markings
with unmoved eye; to view their output<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
with normal pulse; to hear “the cock’s
shrill clarion” without pricking up my
ears; to read of the latest thing in incubators
without turning a hair: for I have
survived the fever; I am an immune.</p>

“AMICUS REDIVIVUS”</h4>

<p class="drop-cap">Josephus says, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Post hoc ergo
propter hoc</span>,” and it might well
be applied to the concerns of this
day, for what one of us has not at some
time or other felt a “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pactum illicitum</span>,” a
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">qualis ab incepto</span>,” as it were, permeating
his whole being, and bringing vividly before
the retina the transitory state of all
things worldly? As Chaucer said:</p>

<p>For it cannot be gainsaid that, despite
the tendency toward materialism, the
cosmic rush and the spiritual captivity that
lead so many brave souls into the martyrdom
of Achiacharus, there is in all of us a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
certain quality that must and will assert
itself.</p>

<p>It seems but yesterday that Shelley, in
his poem on “Mutability,” said:</p>

We <em>are</em> as clouds. You who boast yourself

How well Goethe knew this! We all remember

<p>The greatest poets, from Le Gallienne
down to Shakspere, have been aware of
this evanescent property in the cumbrous
and exsufflicate prowlers amid these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
“glimpses of the moon.” Well may we say
with Cæsar, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quamdiu se bene gesserit</span>.”</p>

<p>There is always a touch of ozone in the
words of Horace, and we find him saying
of this very thing, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Precieuse ridicules
pretiosa supellex</span>.”
Could it
have been said
better? How
airily he pricks
the bubble of
man’s self-esteem!
“Dressed
in a little brief
authority,” man
plays his part
amid mundane
happenings tremelloid
and sejant, and with a sort of innate
connascence, a primitive conglutinate
efflorescence, he approaches nearer and
nearer, day by day, to that time when, as
Shakspere hath it, “the beachy girdle of
the ocean” will resolve itself into its component
parts, and man as man will cease
to exist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span></p>

<p>But, to pass to a more inchoate view
of these things,&mdash;to the “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">opum furiata
cupido</span>” of the ancient Latins,&mdash;what is
there in all this that tends to lessen a
man’s self-glorification, his auto-apotheosis?
Victor Hugo can tell us:</p>

<p>The author of “Les Misérables” was

<p>“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Noblesse oblige</span>,” and it behooves all
of us, however mighty our positions in life,
to unbend a little and try to mollify these

THE PROPER CARE OF FLIES</h4>
</div>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_dci.jpg"  alt="I" /></div>

<p class="drop-cap">It is a fact beyond cavil that ninety-nine
flies out of a hundred perish
every year for lack of proper
care on the part of housewives; that the
attention that is lavished upon the house-cat,
if expended upon the house-fly, would
cause him to stay with us throughout the
twelvemonth.</p>

<p>I have devoted years of patient study
to the busy buzzers, and I speak as one
having authority. Flies need warmth as
much as humans do&mdash;nay, more than their
biped brethren, for we can stand the early
autumn frosts without a fire, but it is those
few days that kill off the little fellows that
have been our winged companions through
the summer season, singing in the new<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
day, sampling our butter and meats, and
tickling us half to death with their erratic
pilgrimages and divagations. A little
forethought on our part, a speedier lighting
of the furnace fires, and flies in midwinter
would no longer be a rarity.</p>

<p>This well-nigh universal carelessness is
due to a woeful ignorance as to the habits
of the fly, and not to intentional cruelty.
Why, we know more about the ways of
the wapiti than of the most common occupant
of our houses. To give an instance,
most people refer to the fly as a scavenger,
a lover of tainted meats and vegetables.
This is only because he is so often forced to
eat tainted meat or go without altogether.
There are fresh milk and fish for the cat,
<ins class="corr" id="tn-237" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'dainty titbits'">
dainty tidbits</ins> for the dog, millet and rape
for the canary; yet how many Christian
people think to provide something tempting
for the flies? But too often we begrudge
them the crumbs that fall from the
table.</p>

<p>So far from flies loving “high” meat, it
is an acquired taste with them. This had
long been a theory with me, but it is only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
a year since I proved it by an interesting
experiment. I secured a setting of flies’
eggs,&mdash;not thoroughbred eggs, but just the
ordinary barn-yard variety,&mdash;and I set them
under a motherly bluebottle fly, after I
had made her a comfortable nest in a pill-box.
I saw to it that she had the proper
food for a setting fly&mdash;not mush and milk,
but flakes of hominy and grains of sugar
once a day. I also dusted her nest thoroughly
with insecticide and covered her
with a tea-strainer so that she would be
secure from molestation from other flies.
For three weeks she was faithful to her
duties, and then, one morning, I saw that
she had experienced the sweet joys of
motherhood, for there, on the edge of her
nest, sat thirteen&mdash;mark the number&mdash;cunning
little flies, pluming and preening
themselves with innate skill. I could
scarce keep back the tears.</p>

</div>

<p>For a few days I let the little flock follow
their mother, and then I shut them
up away from her in my guest-chamber
and began their education. The sweetest
milk was theirs from the start, and after a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
week of bread diet, that their feathers
might be strengthened, I began to give
them small scraps of porter-house steak
and Southdown mutton. It was wonderful
to see how the little beggars throve.
One night I slept in the guest-chamber,
and they awoke me before the robin’s
matin song, although they were not three
weeks old. Their tread had a firmness, a
titillating power, that never comes to a
tramp fly or to one improperly nurtured.
Then, their buzzing was so sonorous that
sleep was impossible once they tuned up,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
so I was in no danger of becoming a
drowse-abed.</p>

<p>When they were two months old I determined
to test my theory. I procured
some meat from the larder of a gormand
friend of mine, and brought it into my
guest-chamber in an air-tight box. Then
I opened the box and awaited developments.
If flies are natural-born birds of
carrion, then they would rush upon this stuff
with avidity. I hid behind the arras&mdash;if I am
quite sure what arrases are&mdash;and watched
my little pets with some concern. They
flew over to the meat, sniffed it disdainfully,
buzzed with ire for a few seconds,
and then flew to the ceiling with every
appearance of disgust. Then the largest
one signaled to his fellows, and they flew
down once more, lifted the “condemned
beef” in their talons as firemen seize a
life-preserving net, and sailed to the open
window, where they dropped it. In five
minutes’ time it was black with flies that
had not received proper nurture. Was I
pleased? I was delighted. I set forth a
feast of sugar on top of my bald head, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
sat in the guest-chamber until my pets
had made an end of eating.</p>

<p>The nineteenth century is nearing its
close, and the house-fly is not a perfect
insect; but, housekeeper, it lies with
you to improve the breed. Exercise a
little care in the choice of their food, and
when the biting days of early fall come
upon the land, make provision for warming
your little guests of the summer days,
and if the winds of winter whistle sharp
they will be answered by the hot little
buzz of myriads of flies.</p>
